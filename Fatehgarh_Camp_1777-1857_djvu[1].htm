The Picture of Lord Lake. 



The painting of Lord Lake and his Staff at Fatehgarh in November 
1804, executed by the artist Robert Home during his residence at 
Calcutta (1795-1814), stands at the far end of the Portrait Gallery in 
the Victoria Memorial at Calcutta. This picture, reckoned to be one of 
the finest in Calcutta, was for a long period of time relegated to the 
obscurity of the staircase in the Town Hall. Nothing was visible but the 
dim figure of Lord Lake, sitting on a horse of brown colour. In 1901 a 
restoration was carried out by Mr. Alexander Scott, which revealed the 
brown horse to be a grey charger, and showed Lord Lake's son and 
A.D.C. on a black horse on his right. In the background the details of 
a military review made their appearance. The following inscription is 
on the picture : " Gerard, Viscount Lake, Baron of Delhi and Laswaree, 
Commander-in-Chief in India 1800-1807. Born 1744. Died 1809." 

Robert Home, the artist, was a native of London. He had exhibited 
at the Royal Academy before arriving at Madras, probably in 1790. 
From Madras he moved up to Calcutta, and from that place found his 
way to Lucknow. He was appointed as Court Painter by Nawab Asaf- 
ud-Daula. In 1795, however, he was back again in Calcutta, but a 
second time securing the post of Court Painter to the King of Oudh, he 
returned to Lucknow, and is mentioned as having painted the portrait 
of Bishop Heber there in 1824. He then apparently settled at Cawnpore. 



CHAPTER I. 

THE TEMPORARY BRIGADE. 



HE territory covered by the Farrukhabad District frequently changed 
rulers during the eighteenth century, for it was almost exactly 
divided between two rival Governments. The portion to the north of 
the Kali Nadi paid tribute to the Nawab of Rohilkhand, while the 
administration of the country to the south of that river lay in the hands 
of the Nawab Vizier of Oudh, or the " Nabob Vizier", as he was 
popularly called by Englishmen of the time. With the help of forces 
sent by Warren Hastings the Nawab Vizier was able to defeat the 
Rohillas in 1774, and acquire the suzerainty of the whole district. The 
local potentate was the Bangash Nawab of Farrukhabad, whose allegiance 
had now to be given to Lucknow together with an annual payment 
of four and a half lakhs of rupees. The Nawab Vizier himself was 
within a year involved in difficulties, which forced him to enter into 
the Treaty of Fyzabad with the East India Company in 1775, and he 
agreed to a regular brigade of the Company's troops being stationed in 
Oudh for his protection. The Cantonment of Cawnpore, or " Cawnpore 
Camp ", thus came into existence. He later applied for a force to be 
officered by British officers, which would be incorporated with the 
Company's troops, and paid from his revenues. He had already in his 
service a large body of troops commanded by British officers ; and this 
fact must not be forgotten, since many of the battalions of infantry, which 
were officially posted to the new camp of Fatehgarh after August 1777, 
were already in the vicinity of Farrukhabad, or living in the Cantonments 
at Mainpuri and Faizpur Camp (3rd Brigade) near Bilgram in the Hardoi 
District. Scattered detachments, too, were on duty in Rohilkhand and 
all over the Mainpuri and Etawah Districts, Lt.-Colonel Thomas Goddard 
being in command. 

The proceedings of the Governor-General's Council dated the 4th 
August 1777 were contained in a resolution that the troops "now in the 



Nabob of Oudh's service and commanded by British officers should be 
transferred to the Company and annexed to the three existing brigades ". 
It was ordered that the Vizier's troops in and around Farrukhabad should 
be united and modelled into a new brigade. Colonel Goddard in 
compliance with these orders formed the new, or temporary brigade, and 
was its first commauder up to October 1777. The resolution also contained 
some instructions in detail. Each of the three regular brigades was 
required to send three battalions of infantry and one company of artillery 
to him, each battalion to be commanded by a captain and two subalterns. 
Each company of artillery was to have a captain-lieutenant and a 
lieutenant-fireworker. In addition, there were to be four regiments of 
cavalry with a captain, two lieutenants and 480 troopers in each. One 
regiment was not to be raised for the time being. The brigade was to be 
called the " Temporary Brigade ". It was to continue for two years, 
and be relieved by similar detachments from the other three brigades. 
Troopers were to be mounted on their own horses. Returns were to be 
made as in the Company's army. Stores would be sent from the Patna 
and Chunar magazines at the Nawab's expense. Troops were to be clothed 
from the Company's warehouses. The new brigade was to be counted 
as a fourth brigade in one general return, but at the same time to be 
returned by Commanding Officers of the different brigades to which they 
belonged as detachments from those brigades. The three brigades sent 
28 British sergeants for the infantry, and 10 British sergeants for the 
artillery of the new brigade. 

It is evident from these orders that the brigade was at that period a 
larger formation than the brigade of after years. The whole Bengal 
Army, roughly twenty-five thousand men in strength, was divided into 
three brigades by the organisation of 1765. A brigade was made up by 
1 European battalion, 1 company of European artillery, 1 cavalry regiment, 
and 7 infantry battalions. The result of the Governor-General's orders 
was that each detached a force equal to a modern brigade, in order to 
form the Temporary Brigade at Fatehgarh. The Nawab Vizier gave up 
nine infantry battalions, which were allotted, three to each of the Bengal 
Army brigades; and the intention was to form the Fatehgarh garrison 



out of the battalions replaced by the Nawab Vizier's troops. There was 
probably some difference in discipline and training to the disadvantage of 
the Nawab Vizier's troops, who had less British officers and no British 
non-commissioned officers, as compared with the Company's troops. The 
former however were actually cantoned in, or near, the area of the new 
Temporary Brigade. It would have been o waste of time to march them 
to Dinapore, Midnapore, and other distant Cantonments of the Bengal 
Army brigades, to which they now belonged. They were accordingly left 
where they were, and joined their brigades on paper only. The three 
companies of Indian artillery remained with the Temporary Brigade. This 
was the first employment of such artillery by the British. Up to that 
date the artillery companies had been European in personnel. The three 
companies of the new artillery actually received a greater number of 
officers than that which had been ordered. Major Patrick Duff was the 
Officer Commanding; and he had under his command three captains, one 
lieutenant, five lieutenant-fireworkers, an adjutant, and a quartermaster. 
As subsequent events showed, the artillery proved to be the most efficient 
and best disciplined corps of the Temporary Brigade. Its British non- 
commissioned officers were men of good stamp. They were selected for 
posts bearing responsibility, like those of provost sergeant, supervisor of 
bazars, and supervisor of bullock lines. The infantry were relieved almost 
annually after 1780 and both officers and men, grumbled a good deal over 
it. The cavalry, on the other hand, were left at Fatehgarh for four years, 
the 2nd Regiment staying with short exceptions for nearly twenty years. 
The formal transfer of the Vizier's troops to the Company's service 
took place in September 1777. Fatehgarh was selected as a Cantonment 
in order to cover Lucknow, and for communication with that place and 
(the detached posts in Rohilkhand. From Fatehgarh the Jumna ghats 
could also be watched, and incursions by those fords prevented. The 
Nawab Vizier had an empty fort at Fatehgarh, which could be made use- 
ful. By this fort was a flat plain along the Ganges, containing the three 
villages of Bholepur, Bhakramau, and Husainpur, which survive to-day in 
the two former cases as integral parts of Cantonments and the Municipal 
Area of Fatehgarh. The plain was devoid of trees, except in the vicinity 



of the villages, and was covered with out-croppings of kankar. It was, 
notwithstanding these disadvantages, considered as suitable for the new 
Cantonment, or " Camp ", as it was called up to the Mutiny. 

Long before the official resolution of the 4th August some orders 
must have been issued to the Commander of the Vizier's troops; for the 
laying out of the Fatehgarh Camp started in May 1777. There is evi- 
dence of the occupation of the Fatehgarh plain at an even earlier date, 
namely in 1776, in which year a cavalry regiment was being raised by 
Captain Marsack just outside Farrukhabad City. Lieutenant R. Foley 
of the 5th Battalion of Sepoys, commanding a company of the Nawab 
Vizier's artillery, made his will on the 1st November 1776 in camp near 
Farrukhabad. He was killed in action near Mainpuri in the following 
March; for throughout the whole year 1777 the country around Farrukha- 
bad was in a state of great confusion, refractory zemindars shutting them- 
selves up in their forts, and setting the Nawab Vizier's Government at 
defiance, particularly along the Jumna in the Ftawah District. Sheo 
Singh, master of the forts at Ahaundi and Tungha, was the most notori- 
ous. During a greater part of the year Lt. -Colonel Goddard was oppos- 
ing him with a strong body of the Nawab Vizier's troops, until at the 
end of the year he was driven across the Jumna. In consequence of these 
operations the concentration at Fatehgarh, therefore, appears to have been 
very gradual. Troops were moving there from Mainpuri during the 
winter of 1776-77. Mainpuri, in fact, had not been evacuated by April, 
since on the 3rd April Captain Charles Ware sent a complaint to the 
Governor-General from that place. He protested against being super- 
seded in promotion by Captain Thomas Nay lor. 

Charles Ware (1740-1803) started his career in the 85th and 84th 
Foot, being present at the capture of Manila in 1762. He had served, 
on the Bombay side of India with the 84th, and left the regiment with 
other officers on transfer to the Bengal Army of the East India Company, 
when the regiment went to Bengal from Bombay in 1764. He had thus 
been serving several years in the British Army before Naylor had even 
arrived in India. Naylor went out to India in 1764 as Purser of the 
" Success ", Indiaman. He obtained a cadetship from Lord Clive in the 



following year, and it is hard to understand how he could ever have been 
placed above Ware, The latter, however, was made senior, and put in 
command of the 24th Battalion of the Temporary Brigade, Naylor com- 
manding the 30th. The 30th Battalion survived all changes up to 1931, 
when it was known as the 4/lst Punjab Regiment. Ware became a 
notable character. He commanded the 1st Brigade in the Rohilla War 
of 1794. On the outbreak of the 2nd Mahratta War he was a Major 
General commanding at Fatehgarh, and joining Lord Lake's Grand Army 
at Gursahaiganj was put in charge of the Right Brigade. He was pre- 
sent at all the actions fought by Lord Lake, until he lost his life at 
Laswari, his head being taken off by a round shot. He was known to be 
the most hospitable man in the country ; for he had entrusted his savings 
to a friend, who embezzled them, and on hearing the news he vowed he 
would never again save another penny. 

Fatehgarh Cantonment was modelled on that of Mainpuri, and a 
general order dated the 18th May 1777 by the Q. M. G. of the Nawab 
Vizier's forces definitely marks the beginning of the work of laying it out. 
This general order, which unfortunately has not been traced, allotted 
sites for officers' Iningalows and lines for the sepoys. Subsequent reports 
give information about the Lines, but beyond the fact that the bungalows 
were first constructed on the bank overlooking the Ganges no details 
about them have been given. This much is known that the three bun- 
galows from Hospital Ghat, which in later years housed the General 
Hospital, formed the headquarters of the Temporary Brigade. The 
general appearance of the bungalows, lining the Strand Road, can be 
easily imagined, since a few years later these residences were said to be 
like those at Cawnpore. It was many months, however, before house 
accommodation could be fully provided. In December 1777 artillery 
and cavalry officers were still living in tents. 

The Q. M. G. of the Nawab Vizier's troops, who was responsible for 
the laying out of Fatehgarh was Captain Primrose Thompson, of whom 
very little is known. Ten years before he was an Fnsign. He died at 
Cawnpore in October 1778, being styled, " Late Q. M. G. to the Vizier 
of Indostan's Army ". His proceedings at Fatehgarh are revealed by 



papers dealing with a fierce quarrel with Captain Marsack, who since 
the beginning of the winter of 1776 had been busily engaged in raising a 
cavalry regiment near Farrukhabad City. The following interesting 
details about the latter officer have been given by Major Hodson. Charles 
Marsack (1735-1820) was a natural son of George II by Marguerite de 
Marsack. He was an Ensign in 1765, but resigning his commission in 
the following year, was readmitted in 1766. He resigned a second time 
in 1779, and left India. He purchased Caversham Park, Oxon, from the 
1st Earl Cadogan, and in 1787 was J. P. and High Sheriff of the county. 
He died at Caversham in 1820, aged 84. 

On the 22nd of May Colonel Goddard had to go to Lucknow. He 
left in temporary command Captain Ware, who himself on the 15th June 
had to take a colunvi into Rohilkhand in order to relieve troops. Ware 
handed over charge ot Fatehgarh to Marsack by letter, as the latter was 
three or four miles away. The senior officer at Fatehgarh was Captain 
Primrose Thompson, who was involved in a good deal of bother at the 
time. He was guarding a vast quantity of stores, which had been dumped 
down on the plain by the Fort. He had just laid out lines for the 
infantry, and the sepoys were objecting to the form of the huts. They 
did not approve of double rows of huts behind bells of arms, as ordered 
by Thompson. They showed their disapproval by trying to set them on 
fire. Thompson complained particularly of the l/2nd and 5th Regiments. 
He wanted orders to be issued, and did not know that Ware had gone. 
He asked Ensign Hicks, who was acting as Adjutant, to show him the 
orderly book. That day, the 17th June, Hicks was away at Lutinbagh, 
the name of the place where Captain Marsack was then raising his regi- 
ment. Thompson found that Marsack was in charge, although he was 
several miles away, and could be therefore of no assistance in laying out 
the Cantonment. Objection was at once made to Colonel Goddard, who 
wrote to Marsack and ordered him to hand over charge to Thompson, 
since he was not at Fatehgarh, and not in proper charge because his 
regiment was not yet part of the brigade. On the 19th June at midnight 
Marsack wrote a general order which he dated the 19th June, giving the, 
substance of Colonel Goddard's order. He inserted this general order 



into the orderly book. The next day Thompson assuming charge of Fateh- 
garh and examining the orderly book, found the general order in it. His 
first act as Commanding Officer was to have that order erased. 

It was the hot weather, and both officers were living in tents. It is 
no matter for surprise therefore, to find that a violent quarrel broke 
out, which was the cause of a lengthy correspondence with Goddard in 
Lucknow. On the 23rd June Thompson plaintively remarks in one of 
his letters to Lucknow, (and both he and Marsack seem to have written 
three or four a day to Goddard.) " Since you left me, it seems to be 
my fate to be for ever writing and yours to be ever reading " ! Colonel 
Goddard was unable to settle the dispute, which continued to rage 
furiously for another two months. The whole file, a most voluminous 
one, was sent up to General Clavering, the Commander-in-Chief at 
Calcutta. On Goddard's return to Fatehgarh, both officers appeared 
before him in conformance with the Commander-in-Chief's order that 
the matter was to be settled at once. Thompson apologised for erasing 
the order. Colonel Goddard censured Marsack for inserting his letter 
into a general order as " unnecessary and unmilitary." He considered 
that Captain Ware had been wrong in handing over command to Marsack. 

The Infantry Lines and bungalows were all in being by the time 
the transfer of the Nawab Vizier's troops to the East India Company's 
service took place in September. The records show that the troops had 
considered themselves to be in the new service even many months 
previously. The words "Nawab Vizier' 7 had been employed as an 
official description without real meaning. It was evident that all troops 
turned their eyes to Calcutta. In September the appointments to the 
new brigade were settled. At Fatehgarh on the 17th, Lieutenant 
p. Young wrote to Colonel Goddard for leave in a letter the (juaint 
phraseology of which is worth reproducing: " Sir, he wrote, " the 
repeated shocks that my health has received during nine years which I 
have had the honour of serving the Hon'ble Company in this country, 
renders it indispensably necessary for me to return to Europe by the 
ships of this season, which the Surgeons advise as the only possible means 
I have left of recruiting a shattered constitution. I am therefore reduced 



8 



to the disagreeable necessity of applying for permission to go to the 
Presidency in order to prepare for my voyage, which I flattei myself you 
will be kind enough to consent to and that you will be pleased to make 
my request known to the Commander-in-Chief." The leave was granted, 
but nowhere in the letter or in the Commander-in-Chief's order is the 
amount of leave mentioned. 

The constitution of the new brigade was announced as follows : —

Colonel Matthew Leslie, commanding the 1st Brigade, took over 
command of the Temporary Brigade at Fatehgarh on the morning of the 
29th October 1777 from Colonel Goddard, and reported thai day to the 
Governor-General, Warren Hastings. He was probably the most 
experienced officer then serving in Bengal, and had seen much active 
service. Major Hodson describes his career as starting in 1745. 
" Matthew Leslie, Surgeon, to be Second Surgeon's Mate of Our Garrison 
in Our Island of Cape Breton, N. America/' are the words of the first 
notice found about him. He was one of the three Surgeon's Mates to 
the Hospital in N. America in 1754. There he was appointed directly as 
Lieutenant, 48th Foot, without being Ensign. He was present in America 
during the Seven Years' War. After serving in the expedition to Fort 
du Quesne, the battle of Quebec in 1759, and the capture of Havana in 
1762, he was transferred as Lt. -Colonel to the Bengal Army in 1768. He 
commanded the Right Wing of the forces in the 1st Rohilla War. 

Colonel Leslie's first occupation was a minute inspection of the new 
Cantonment. His reports to the Commander-in-Chief at Calcutta are full 
of interest. All that is known of Fatehgarh and its appearance in the 
first year of its history, is derived from them. He found the state of the 
troops to be anything but satisfactory. The officers were irascible and 
prone to quarrel at the slightest pretext; and the history of the first 
twenty years of Fatehgarh's existence is chiefly the relation of quarrels 
and courts-martial, which kept the Officer Commanding and his Deputy 
Judge Advocate continually busy. The echoes of one such quarrel were 



10 

still to be heard at the time of Colonel Leslie's arrival. The trouble 
arose on the appearance of Captain Law with the advance squadron of 
Captain Webber's 2nd Regiment of Cavalry from Benares. Captain 
Webber had been left at Allahabad ill of fever. Captain Law immediately 
on arrival arrogantly demanded several months' pay and horse rations 
from O'Donnell, the Paymaster, who referred to Colonel Goddard for 
orders, since Captain Webber had also written for them. In any case 
such demands had to be refused. Colonel Goddard agreed, and replied 
that no payments would be made until Captain Webber arrived. Law 
fell into a furious rage, and as seems to bu the invariable custom of 
the eighteenth century officer, drafted an appeal to the Commander-in- 
Chief against his Commanding Officer in language which was anything 
but temperate. He stigmatised Colonel Goddard's order as " injurious 
to himself and contradictory to the rules of the service." Goddard's 
order, however, was upheld at Calcutta. 

Leslie reported to the Commander-in-Chief on the 5th November 
that most of the Temporary Brigade with almost all the stores were away 
with Colonel Goddard in the District. He found the troops were long in 
arrears of pay and in want of rations. The night before (4th November) 
he discovered that disaffection was so great among the troops that he 
feared a mutiny would break out. Captain Fairfax's 3rd Regiment of 
Cavalry was in a dangerous state. A number of duffadars belonging to 
the other two regiments had become supernumerary. They were ordered 
to join Captain Fairfax's regiment as privates until vacancies could be 
found for them. They demanded to be paid off and discharged Leslie 
had no cash. The duffadars became clamorous on parade, and on Captain 
Fairfax ordering the ringleaders to be arrested, drew their swords, and 
attacked the stable guard in order to make off with their horses. The 
Cavalry Lines, it should be remembered, were at Rakha. In the midst of 
the tumult Captain Fairfax's horse bolted. It was some time before he 
could call up a battalion of sepoys from Fatehgarh, and have the stables 
surrounded. The mutineers, however, including 78 duffadars and 100 
troopers, got away from Rakha with four horses. In the darkness a few 
others were wounded by bayonets, and it was not until dawn that order 



11 

was restored. A second inisforlune for the Officer Commanding was 
apparent the next morning, when the body of the new cavalry commander, 
Major Hessman, was brought into Fatehgarh for burial, and this at a 
time when the cavalry corps was in special need of a firm controlling 
hand. Major Hessman was on his way to take up his appointment, when 
he quarrelled with Colonel Ironside at Kanauj. The result was a 
" rencounter," as Leslie reported it, or duel, in which Hessman was killed 
outright. Major Auchmuty brought in the body. Colonel Goddard was 
called in from field service, and given the command of the cavalry, Colonel 
Muir taking his place. The month of November was not to finish without 
further trouble for the new commander. The sepoys, thinking that their 
arrears of pay were to be withheld, became mutinous on the 18th, and 
planned to seize the artillery. Colonel Goddard arrived at the Lines with 
Captain Webber's regiment of cavalry, Captain Rawstorne r s battalion, 
and the heavy artillery. An outbreak was thus averted, and some arrears 
being doled out discontent was allayed. 

The District, too, was producing as much worry as that caused by 
the insubordination at Fatehgarh. The ruler, or Amil, of the District on 
behalf of the Nawab Vizier was at this period the famous Almas Ali Khan, 
He was the sworn enemy of the zamindars, and constantly demanded the 
aid of the troops to drive them from their forts. His headquarters were 
at Mehndi Ghat near Kanauj. The remains of his camp, an excellent 
example of eighteenth century field fortifications, are still to be seen at 
that place in splendid preservation. Almas Ali Khan had just borrowed 
Captain Landeg's battalion, and had not returned it. He now asked for 
two more battalions and some heavy artillery. Leslie refused the 
requisition, and the Governor-General backed him up. It was essential to 
preserve the zamindars' forts along the Jumna and in the Duab for 
keeping off the Mahrattas, and it was most inexpedient to allow Almas 
Ali Khan to destroy them. Leslie's opinion, in fact, was that the troops 
at Fatehgarh should be employed to help the zamindars. With that 
object in view he had placed a detchment at Etawah, a second at Tungha 
Fort near Kalpi, a third at Derinagar on the other side of the Ganges to 
protect Rohilkhand, and a whole battalion at Moradabad for the internal 



12 

security of that area. One zamindar did not commend himself to Leslie. 
In view of the notoriety acquired by his descendants up to 1857, there 
seems to be justification for the expedition against the zamindar of 
Thathia in December 1777, when four battalions and one regiment of 
cavalry, accompanied by two companies of artillery and the " battering 
artillery " of the Nawab Vizier under Major Duff, set off under the 
command of Colonel Leslie himself for that place. On the 7th January 
1778 this large force camped at Rampora, one and a half kos from 
Thathia, and so overawed the recalcitrant zamindar that he paid all 
arrears of revenue at once. The second expedition to Thatia was in 1803, 
an event which is marked by the tomb of the commander, Colonel Guthrie, 
still to be seen within a few hundred yards of the remains of the fort. The 
last holder of Thathia rebelled in the Mutiny, and the fort was completely 
demolished by a column under Major-General Windham. The lofty mound, 
covered with the debris of the fort, which stood upon it, is all that is left 
to-day. 

The condition of the troops in 1777 left much to be desired. 
Discontent, due to the existence of long arrears of pay, was rife. There 
was a general aversion to coming on to the new establishment. The 
artillery corps with its " lascars and golandazes " was in excellent order 
and discipline, and this was the solitary exception. On the other hand 
the magazine and ordnance stores belonging to the artillery were in 
confusion and unserviceable to boot. The cavalry regiments and horses 
were in miserable condition. The discipline of all was bad. Captain 
Webber's regiment had a scandalous appearance, being badly clothed in 
dyed nankeen, and using worn out bridles and saddles. The infantry were 
in better order, but their clothing was not good. The Fort was in bad 
repair and empty. The magazine was in part of an old mosque and most 
insufficient. Leslie recommended that it should be moved to the Fort. He 
appointed a committee under Major Duff to examine the guns and 
ordnance stores of the infantry battalions; for each battalion had two 
brass guns, either five and a half, or six-pounders, in calibre. The 
committee discovered that out of the eighteen guns of the infantry and those 
also of the brigade artillery, no less than twenty-four were unfit for use. 



13 

Colonel Leslie had little chance of carrying out reforms. The report 
on the artillery was still being digested by him, when orders were received 
calling him to the command of the column which was to march across 
India from Cawnpore to help the Bombay Government against the 
Mahrattas. He left Fatehgarh on the 14th April handing over charge 
to Lt. -Colonel Muir. The energy which he had shown in Fatehgarh seems 
to have left him, and this is hardly a matter for wonder. Leslie led his 
column of six battalions from the 1st Brigade with some cavalry and 
artillery into Bundelkhand in a very leisurely manner. The hot weather 
was in progress, and at the very commencement of the march an officer 
named Captain Crawford died of sunstroke, a circumstance which after- 
wards was made the subject of recriminations between Warren Hastings 
and his rival F'rancis in the Council room at Calcutta, since Francis 
affirmed that Leslie had suppressed the matter. Leslie was no longer 
young, and was probably unfit for active service. Owing to his 
dilatoriness, the Bengal Government ordered Colonel Goddard to go and 
supersede him. Leslie died, however, at Rajgarh in Central India on the 
3rd October 177S before the order of supersession reached him. 

The next permanent commander was Lt. -Colonel Benjamin Wilding 
(1732-1780), for Colonel Muir seems to have been busy preparing for field 
service, and was only at Fatehgarh a few days. Colonel Wilding's report 
of the 19th May 177H gives invaluable details concerning the new Lines. 
These details together with scattered allusions in other reports, specially 
those of the annual surveys of public buildings in the Cantonments, make 
it possible to describe the extent and appearance of the Lines with some 
exactitude. Wilding had been a cadet as far ago as 1759, and had seen 
a good deal of service. In 1759 he was at the storming of Masulipatam 
and at Buxar in 1764. He was one of those who resigned during the 
" Batta Mutiny " and went home ; but he was readmitted and returned to 
India, subsequently commanding at Chunar and Monghyr before coming 
to Fatehgarh. He died at Calcutta in command of the 2nd Brigade. 

Two bridges marked the right and the left ends of the Lines respec- 
tively. By these bridges were set up Sepoy Guard Rooms, consisting of 
thatched roofs, supported by mango wood posts, and with grass mats as 



14 

walls. These bridges, several times renewed since the eighteenth century, 
are still in use, for they bridge deep nullahs, and are essential for 
preserving communications within the Cantonment. The bridge on the 
right of the line carries the road to No. 2 Bungalow and Hospital Ghat, 
and is nearly opposite the Indian Military Hospital. The Lines started 
in the compound of the present Military Hospital, and stretched without 
a break nearly to the Queen Victoria Memorial by Fatehgarh Town. In 
front of the right of the line, that is, where the Mint House now stands, 
was a long shed of thatched roof and mango wood posts, in which were 
kept the guns of the brigade artillery. Their stores were placed in an 
old mosque, belonging to the adjoining village of Husainpur. The bridge 
and Sepoy Guard Room on the left of the line were behind No. 15 
Bungalow. The bridge now carries the Post Office Road over the wide 
nullah leading to Bargadia Ghat. The road was not built, however, 
until after 1857. The left of the line was occupied by the guns of the 
infantry battalions, eighteen in number. The gun sheds together with 
the quarters of the gunners prolonged the line nearly up to Fatehgarh 
Town. Between these two bridges on both sides of the Mall Road, two 
rows of bamboo and straw huts provided accommodation for six batta- 
lions, each battalion having ten bells of arms in front of it on the edge of 
the parade ground, and facing west. These bells of arms were 12 feet 
square, made of sun-dried bricks, and covered by flat mud roofs under a 
thatched outer roof. There was one quarter- and one rear-guard for each 
battalion, built in exactly the same manner. On the right of each 
battalion was a small bungalow for British sergeants, 28 of whom had 
been sent to the Temporary Brigade for employment with the infantry. 

The abundant vegetation and avenues of him trees, which now exist 
in this part of the Cantonment, have changed the scene. In 1777 the 
ground was a flat and barren plain, covered with kankar stone. There 
were no trees of any description. The plain stretched from the Fort to 
the ravines near Rakha, which was called the " Rear " in contemporary 
reports. The cavalry set up their quarters and stables on the old hunting 
preserve of the Nawabs of Farrukhabad, forming an almost separate 
Cantonment of their own. The brigade bazar was formed between the 



15 

cavalry and the infantry, and became the nucleus of the existing town of 
Fatehgarh. It was merely a collection of straw huts, which in eighteenth 
century language were called " boutiques/' Besides the dusty track, 
which bisected the Sepoy Lines, there was only one other road. Along 
this road, following the bank of the Ganges, the officers set up their 
houses in such numbers that the space must have been badly congested. 
The three end bungalows to the north by Hospital Ghat were reserved for 
Brigade Headquarters. Hospital accommodation consisted of two sheds 
in the Infantry Lines, and a larger collection of huts and mud buildings 
by the bazar, which seems to have been in or near to the present Company 
Bagh in the Civil Station. A bungalow was built next door to the Fort, 
but with this exception there appears to have been no houses built any- 
where outside the Strand Road. The whole society of Fatehgarh iu the 
eighteenth century congregated in this road which, it must be remembered, 
started farther to the north than it does at present. It began at Hospital 
Ghat, traversing the plain iu front of No. 2 Bungalow, so as to give 
access to the bungalows on the river bank. The ruins of the old bridge, 
by which the road crossed the nullah to the north of the Court, where the 
officers of the 10/7th Rajput Regiment now play squash racquets, can be 
plainly discovered in the undergrowth. The road then emerged from the 
Park by the present entrance of the Officers' Mess, and continued, as it 
does now, to the Civil Lines and Rakha. The oldest public work in 
Fatehgarh is on this road. The bridge over the nullah by No. 13 
Bungalow has the following inscription let into the wall by the road-aide. 
" This bridge was erected by subscription of the officers etc. at this 
station. A. D. 1788." It was not until 1838 that the road was 
metalled, drained, and tunnels made to carry off the rain water. The 
Junnels cost Rs. 2,000. The Bargadia Ghat nullah, which crosses the 
road, was carefully preserved from trespassers, as the best kind of thatch- 
ing grass grew in it. 

West of the Strand Road lay the Lines of the Sepoys, and further 
west again the parade ground continued right up to the walls of 
Farrukhabad City, an arid plain unrelieved by any trees or buildings, 
over which scoured bands of mounted robbers, called Mewattis. Even so 



10 

late as 1794 a young Civilian, named Twining, writes that he was 
cautioned not to go beyond the parade ground proper in his morning 
rides for fear of being captured by bandits. In April 1787 Major 
Whinyates, the Quartermaster of the 4th Brigade, had a dangerous 
experience in this direction. He was driving Mrs. Whinyates and his 
infant son in a " one horse chair," and returning to Fatehgarh, when 
robbers attacked them with drawn swords near Barhpur. The wings of 
the buggy warded off the cuts made at Major Whinyates, and the party 
only escaped by hard driving over the plain. The Lai Darwaza Road 
did not then exist. The only roads to the City were from Ghatia Ghat 
and Rakha, Both roads crossed numerous nullahs haunted by packs of 
wolves, and being rough country tracks were particularly unsafe for 

wheeled traffic. 

There are several plans of houses in the records, and one has been 
given in the chapter on Husainpui. The smaller kind of bungalow was 
J30 feet long by 20 feet broad, containing one room, partitioned into two 
by a mud wall. This style of house could hardly be simpler, and was 
designed for the sergeants. The officers' houses were larger. Those at 
Cawnpore were described by a tourist named Hodges, who visited that 
Cantonment in 1783. Sale deeds of the early nineteenth century 
indicate the existence of such bungalows at Fatehgarh going back to the 
same period. Hodges says that there was a large room in the centre for 
use as a combined dining and sitting room. At each corner there were 
rooms for sleeping in, the space between them being used as verandahs. 
The walls were made of mud, and the whole was covered with thatch, 
which came down over the walls to a low height. There were no ceiling 
cloths, no windows, or glass to cover the doors, but light and air were 
admitted through wooden lattices. Furniture was confined to straight- 
back chairs, tables, beds, and boxes. Book-cases and pictures are men- 
tioned in the records. The cookhouse and " necessary" were in the 
compound near the outhouses. House-keeping was very primitive. Meat 
was hard to obtain, and English vegetables not at all. Wine was expen- 
sive, and only senior officers could afford to lay in stocks. For most 
officers the only drinks were tea, toddy, and water from the Ganges, which 



17 

was reckoned to be very pure. There were no regimental messes. Each 
officer catered for himself, and usually living with three or four others a 
small mess could be maintained. It was the custom, too, for officers to 
dine with each other in rotation, each bringing his own cutlery and 
plates. Dinner was at 2 p. m., and in the evening there was supper 
followed by card games like whist, five card loo, and tredille. Otherwise 
there were few amusements. It is noteworthy that billiards were much 
played in Fatehgarh. There is no indication given as to where the 
tables were kept. Most probably the Assembly Rooms or theatre, a 
building most certainly in existence by 1804, had been constructed at an 
early date, and contained a billiard room. The tables were very poorly 
constructed, the beds being made of wood, or marble, and the cushions 
stuffed with cotton. Cues were unknown, but balls were struck with maces 
tipped with ivory. The punkha had not been invented, and indoor 
amusements like billiards was a very disagreeable affair in the hot weather. 
Outdoor games were unknown. Riding and shooting were the only forms 
of exercise. Calling was only performed by gentlemen and in the even- 
ing. Even in the hot weather full regimentals were worn; but the red 
cloth coatee could be taken off after the first ceremonies, and replaced by 
a linen coat. After 1785 the Station developed rapidly, and numbers of 
ladies made their appearance. Bungalows about this date became more 
elaborate and much more expensive. Even in 1781 a Major Macpherson 
after great difficulty bought a house for 2,000 sicca rupees, or 210 pounds 
sterling, the equivalent in English money of that period. Major 
Whinyates, also, bought a bungalow in 1786, and lost lis. 1,500 over it 
on selling it the next year. A good sized house with four bedrooms cost 
about Rs. 4,000 in 1700, a sum which would have to be nearly doubled to 
bring it up to modern values. 
* Colonel Wilding's first days in Fatehgarh were occupied with settling 

a curious affair arising out of gossip at the dinner table. Captain Erskine, 
who commanded the 22nd Battalion, demanded a court-martial to clear 
his character. Witnesses stated that at a party in " Lieutenant" Duff's 
quarters (Major P. Duff, Commandant of the brigade artillery) the con- 
versation turned on Mr. Wilson having persuaded Lieutenant McKenzie 



18 

to make a will in his favour. Captain Erskine was alleged to have remarked 
that Lieutenant McKenzie was well-known to be insane, and that in any 
case Mr. Wilson had forged the will. Erskine was apprehensive that he 
would be branded as a libeller ! The result of the enquiry by the Officer 
Commanding is not given. 

The hot weather of 1778 produced the usual court-martial, and in 
this case on the complaint of Colonel Wilding himself. On the 5th June, 
a particularly hot day, he put Lieutenant Archibald Hook of the 22nd 
Battalion under arrest for disrespectful behaviour towards himself. The 
court-martial was sanctioned by the Commander-in-Chief, and ordered for 
the 1st August. Hook then added insult to injury by writing to the 
Commander-in-Chief to the effect that he did not trust a single officer in 
Fatehgarh. He asked to be tried at Cawnpore ! The Commander-in-Chief 
replied that his request was indecent, and he must be tried by the officers 
of his own brigade. He was duly sentenced to suspension for two months, 
and ordered to make a public apology. 

Much improvement had been effected by the following year, when 
General Stibbert came from Calcutta, and made a full inspection. He 
found the 23rd, 25th, 28th and 30th Battalions perfect in drill, firing, 
and manoeuvre. Discipline was good. The 24th and 27th Battalions 
were out on service in the Duab. He found, too, that each battalion had 
40 torn toms and trumpeters, and four drummers. He recommended 
twelve drummers, twelve trumpeters, and less torn toms! The only defect 
was the condition of the transport cattle, which was very bad. 

In August 1781 Major-General Sir John Cuming arrived at Fatehgarh 
to take up the command after an interregnum during which several officers 
had held the command temporarily. Major E. Rawstorne (1745-1801), 
then commanding the 21st Battalion, was perhaps the best known of 
them. He afterwards became a Major-General and Colonel Commandant 
of the newly founded cavalry brigade at Berhampore, where he died. Sir 
John Cuming was transferred to the Bengal Army, like Leslie, from the 
84th Regiment in 1763. He remained at Fatehgarh over four years, a 
long time for a Commanding Officer, and died at St. Helena on his way 
home in 1786. Little of importance beyond courts-martial took place at 



19 

Fatehgarh during his period of command; but Sir John Cuming paid more 
than ordinary attention to such proceedings, and during his time the 
Deputy Judge Advocate was also his Secretary. Captain R. Broome and 
Lieutenant W. Henderson filled this office between 1782 and 1785. The 
unedifying trials of bad-tempered officers, which were held during these 
years, are therefore the chief interest, as they must have been for residents 
of the Station at the time. 

Lieutenant James Fraser of the l/9th Regiment of Sepoys was put on 
his trial in September 1781 on a charge of disrespectful behaviour to his 
Commanding Officer, Major Cooke. He was acquitted. A much bigger 
affair than this was the court-martial of Major Wraj, commanding the 
11th Sepoys. A connected trial was that of Captain Sam. Farmer of 
the 2/21st Sepoys, an officer who is mentioned as executor in the inscription 
on the tomb of Head Surgeon Hamilton in the compound of the District 
Courts. Wray was a cadet in 1*764 In 1788 he rose to the rank of 
Lt.-Colonel commanding the 4th Brigade at Midnapore. He resigned in 
1790, and died 1809. 

The hot weather of 1783 was fairly in progress, when Sir John Cuming 
despatched two battalions to a place called Anupshahr on the Ganges to 
protect the Nawab Vizier's frontier against incursions by the Sikhs. These 
two battalions were the 11th and 2/21st Sepoys. Unfortunately the 
expedition was placed under the command of Lt.-Colonel Christian Knud- 
son, a very unpopular officer, who had himself belonged to the 11th 
Sepoys He was therefore well known to the officers of that corps. Knudson 
was a Dane by birth, and was one of the officers of the 84th Regiment 
who went into the Bengal Army in 1763 at the invitation of the East 
India Company. He afterwards commanded Fatehgarh in 1787, and 
died at Chunar in 1792. The burning heat of May naturally roughened 
every officer's temper, and Knudson precipitated an outburst by his very 
first act. He stupidly ordered the camp to be pitched on an open plain. 
By a singular display of mulishness he refused to listen to any advice, or 
heed the growing murmurs of the troops. The next incident throws a 
flood of light on eighteenth century military practices, when every officer 
was a trader in disguise, and Commanding Officers had more than 



20 

ordinary interest in securing contracts. Knudson had set up the usual 
camp bazar, and Major Wray found one day shortly after that a private 
servant of his had been arrested by Knudson for withdrawing his "boutique*' 
from the bazar and selling grain in a neighbouring tope. On the 18th 
May Major Wray wrote a furious letter to his Commander, and in no 
uncertain terms demanded the release of his servant at once. He added 
some libellous accusations to the effect that Knudson was purposely keeping 
the troops short of grain, although there was abundance in the locality. 
The motive, he stated, was very clear, for Knudson was trying to keep 
the price of grain at a high level for his own profit! On receipt of this 
effusion Knudson put the writer under arrest. Sir John Cuming failing 
to get the matter settled had to apply to the Commander-in-Chief for 
sanctioning a court-martial. 

On the 8th July Major Wray was put on trial, and accused of having 
made false charges against his Commanding Officer with a dishonourable 
intention of injuring his reputation. Wray protested his letter was a 
private one, and not meant to be published. In spite of eighteen years' 
service in the Army he was ordered to be dismissed by the Court. He 
appealed to the Governor-General. The sentence was set aside ; for the 
trial had been full of irregularities. For one thing the accused had been 
presumed guilty, and ordered to prove his innocence. 

Meanwhile, after the arrest of Major Wray, agitation against Colonel 
Kundson was fomented by Captain Farmer, Lieutenants Butler, Atkinson 
and other officers. Acting on instructions from Sir John Cuming, the 
Commander of the force had forbidden all officers to shoot in the villages 
belonging to the Delhi jurisdiction. The officers, filled with resentment, 
abandoned all pretence of discipline. From the evidence given afterwards 
before the Court, it seems evident that there was very strong ground for 
considering the charge against Captain Farmer to be true. He was 
charged with having ordered the Indian Adjutant of his regiment to incite 
the Indian officers of his own regiment and of the 11th Sepoys to complain 
publicly of the hardships, which they were undergoing, by being made to 
camp on an open plain, in the hot May sun without sufficient water. 
Somewhat inexplicably the Court acquitted Captain Farmer, a verdict 



21 

which incensed Sir John Cuming; for he hud deemed the charge to be 
one of incitement to mutiny. This was in July, and, much discontented, 
Sir John Cuming ordered the Court to re-assemble at 10 a. m. on the 3rd 
September at the Resident's Quarters, and revise its proceedings. It 
would be interesting to know where the Resident lived. The reason for 
choosing this house for meeting of the Court was that it was empty at the 
time, there having been no Resident for over two years. There are clues 
pointing to the fact that the Resident lived in Farrukhabad City near the 
Nawab's palace, together with his bodyguard, but nothing certain is known, 
and it seems unlikely that the Court would go to a house more than three 
miles away from Fatehgarh. The result of the proceedings was the same 
as before, the Court maintaining its decision of acquittal. Sir John 
Cuming complained bitterly to the Governor-General of this miscarriage 
of justice, but only obtained cold comfort. He was told he had no power 
to revise the proceedings, and must release Captain Farmer at once; for 
that officer had been under close arrest for five months, and had not been 
set at liberty after his acquittal. The Indian Adjutant of the &amp;/2 1st, 
however, did not escape scot-free. He was suspended from his adjutancy 
for two months. Two sepoys were tried and acquitted, but a third sepoy 
committed contempt of court by refusing to plead at all. He was sentence- 
ed to be dismissed the service, and " to be drummed out with a halter 
about his neck as an example to others. " 

Sir John Cuming was usually successful in getting rid of bad bargains. 
Lack of discipline and insubordination were the worst features of 
garrison life in Fatehgarh in the eighteenth century. On the 23rd Feb- 
ruary 1784, the court-martial of Lieutenant Joseph Earle of the 9th 
Sepoys was ordered. This officer was in command of a detachment of 
200 men, which was ordered to cross the Ganges at the Fort, and march 
towards Amritpur in advance. The remainder of the regiment under 
Major Cooke was to follow. On arriving at the river bank Major Cooke 
found that though the advance detachment had crossed over by the ferry, 
Earle was not with it. Earle, in fact, arrived leisurely some time after- 
wards, dressed in uniform, but without his accoutrements. Major Cooke 
put him under arrest at once. The Court, presided over by Major 



22 

Landeg, passed orders dismissing him from the service Earle's appeal 
was rejected by the Commander-in-Chief, for he had not improved matters 
for himself by writing an abusive letter against Major Cooke in true 
eighteenth century fashion. Earle did not rest even after the rejec- 
tion of his appeal. He drafted a memorial at tremendous length to the 
Governor-General, which he filled with passionate protestations of inno- 
cence, and demands for justice. The Officer Commanding himself was 
not backward in writing offensive letters. Most of 178G had been passed 
in a conflict with Mr. Bristow, the Resident at Lueknow, over supplies to 
the troops, and over accounts. Much heat was expended by both parties, 
but Sir John Cuming was victorious. Mr. Bristow had to complain to 
Government of his personal conduct. 

Sir John Cuming's tenure of the command terminated at the 
end of 1785, when he resigned. Little had happened during the year of 
any moment, A singular way of settling an audit objection occurred in 
March. Lieutenant Grace protested to the Commander-in-Chief that the 
Committee of Accounts at Fatehgarh had disallowed half of his charges 
for repairing the cavalry stables. The Commander-in-Chief was loath to 
go through the accounts, and Sir John Cuming had refrained from making 
any comment on forwarding the protest. A curious order was therefore 
passed to the effect that, if Lieutenant Grace would swear that the repairs 
had cost what he had charged, the bill would be passed. Sir John Cuming 
then broke silence He wrote that he could not allow Grace to take the 
oath required, because, as lie confessed, he had himself given Grace a 
contract to carry out the repairs. Although the Commander-in-Chief 
sensed something dubious about the matter, he reluctantly allowed the 
charges. It was no doubt being realised at Headquarters that the cavalry 
stables at Fatehgarh fell down almost every year. 

It appears that, when Sir John Cuming returned to Bengal from 
leave in 1781, he had been promised the command of a brigade in the 
Nawab Vizier's country, but Colonel Morgan (1742-1819) had been given 
that command, as in effect he was already on the spot, and Cuming was 
sent to Fatehgarh. He now claimed the command of a brigade which 
was about to go into Oudh. The Governor-General and his Board 



28 

refused the claim : Sir John Cuming demanded copies of all orders passed, 
and lectured the " Hon'ble Board " on what he considered was disobe- 
dience to the Company, since apparently the Director of the Company 
had made some kind of promise to him in London. The Board refused 
to allow itself to be bullied, and Sir John Cuming promptly resigned his 
command, handing over charge to Colonel Horton Briscoe on the 9th 
January 1786. He took three years' leave, but in a few months died 
on the way home. 

Colonel Briscoe, (1741-180&amp;) commanded for the next three years, 
and was a hospitable man, who was much liked. He afterwards became 
a Major-General, and died at Calcutta. At one time he had been A.-D.-C. 
to Warren Hastings. It was during his period of command that Fateh- 
garh developed into a well-settled cantonment. Roads were improved, 
and social amenities were greater. The bridge over the Bargadia Ghat 
nullah was built by public subscription. The civil population, mainly 
indigo planters and traders, made its appearance. A few good houses 
were built on the site of the present District Courts in the Civil Lines. 
The flimsy " boutiques *' of the brigade bazar were formed into streets 
on a regular plan, Fatehgarh Town thus rising into being. The Fort 
was thoroughly repaired, and the area to the south of it became covered 
with buildings. Although the fashion was still to rely on thatched mud 
barracks and houses for the accommodation of the troops, tiled roofs and 
walls of sun-baked brick were making their appearance everywhere. The 
Infantry Lines assumed a more orderly arrangement. Battalion store 
rooms, Picquet guard rooms, a Provost Sergeant's bungalow and prison 
guard room, numerous cook rooms, and " necessaries ", or latrines, were 
built on selected sites ; and the old haphazard arrangements of running 
up a shed with grass-mat walls for covering piles of ordnance and other 
military stores were given up. Courts-martial ceased for the time being. 
Fortunately several letters and an interesting diary have come to light, 
which tell of life at Fatehgarh during Colonel Briscoe's regime. The pay 
of the Officers was none too good, and that of the Cavalry was on one 
occasion three months in arrears. Major Whinyates, Quartermaster of 
the 4th Brigade at Fatehgarh, wrote in 1788, that his pay was about 



24 

Rs. 450 per mensem. Colonel Briscoe did much to ameliorate the lot 
of his Officers who were all in debt, and had to pay many charges from 
their allowances. He gave Whinyates a charger, and on the 22nd 
February 1786, he warmly commended a petition from the Officers of the 
Fatehgarh garrison to Lt. -General Sloper, the Commander-in-Chief. 
Officers had to buy their tents and transport cattle, when they went on 
service. They asked for compensation for all such heavy expenses, which 
they had hitherto met from their own pockets. 

Major Thomas Whinyates, (1755-1806) arrived at Fatehgarh, with 
his wife, Catherine Whinyates, on the 31st October 1786, after a tedious 
journey of three and a half months from Calcutta. They came by river, 
and a small fleet consisting of a 20 oared barge, two luggage boats, and 
a cook boat, was necessary to transport them. Letters written by this 
couple from Fatehgarh in 1787, have been preserved in the Whinyates 
family Records, but on the subject of the topography of the station they 
are irritatingly vague. One daughter was born to them at Fatehgarh, 
and they already had au infant son with them. An adventure they had 
with robbers has already been mentioned. Their letters say little about 
Fatehgarh, although one local scandal is alluded to in a letter by Mrs. 
Whinyates. She mentions that one " Valentia de Bois" (l/2nd Bengal 
European Regiment. Died 1826), had been put in irons, and was to be 
tried at the next Sessions for shooting a man whose wife he was carrying 
off. This outrageous person was a brother of Colonel S. Dubois, who 
raised the Dooby ki paltan (l/21st and 41st N. I.) at Fatehgarh in 1803. 
He was also a relative of F. de Seran Dubois, an indigo planter and 
Saltpetre manufacturer in the Husainpur bazar (behind No. 1 Bungalow) 
about 1825. Peter Dubois, a French musician, having contracted a 
marriage with Lady Dorothy Annesley, founded this family, three 
Members of which were connected with Fatehgarh. The 4th Brigade 
marched to Calcutta on the 1st November 1787, and the Whinyates 
accompanied it. They both died in 1806, at Allahabad within a few 
weeks of each other. 

The first full Army List, which exists, is that for the year 1786-87. 
It shows there were six brigades in the Bengal Army of which the 1st 



25 

garrisoned Fatehgarh, being composed of six battalions of infantry, one 
cavalry regiment and a company of artillery. Besides the Commander, 
Colonel Briscoe, there were four surgeons, a commissary of ordnance and 
two conductors, six artillery officers, and 65 cavalry and infantry 
officers, each battalion and the cavalry regiment having British 
sergeant-majors and sergeants in addition. An appointment, which 
will be found mentioned in this and all subsequent lists up to 1808, is 
that of the " Representative of the Governors of the Orphan Society ". 
The Society had its headquarters at Calcutta, and established a Free 
School two years later. This school was divided into the " Upper and 
the Lower School," which explains the laconic expression, often met with 
in the records, referring to a person as coming t* Fatehgarh from the 
"Upper School". The establishment of a special representative at 
Fatehgarh would argue the existence of a numerous population descended 
from soldiers, and probably of Eurasian descent. Lt. -Colonel Peter 
Murray, held the appointment, and the same year became Adjutant- 
General, Bengal. He was killed in 1803, on board the Lord Nelson, in 
action with the French frigate Bellona, off Ferrol. In addition, 
there was the Deputy Paymaster, an officer who seems to have been a 
Civilian. John Becher who held this appointment in 1786, had been 
a Factor of the East India Company five years before. The names 
of Civilian residents are not given in the list, but four years later 
they are stated to be Andrew Elliot (shopkeeper), William Gozna 
(tailor), George Maclean (trader), Laurence Paul (trader), W. P. Wattle 
(trader), and F. Wittpenning (shopman). From the records it is known 
that Paul at any rate had already been many years in Fatehgarh. There 
were others like Robert Carshore and Stewart, who are not mentioned 

at all. 

Captain Jonathan Wood wrote a long letter on the 1st August 
1789 to his friend Ozias Humphrey, R. A., from Fatehgarh. It has 
been published at length in " Bengal, Past and Present ", Vol. 35. In 
it he discloses that he belonged to the 2nd Brigade, which after having 
been stationed for only one year at Cawnpore, relieved a brigade at 
Fatehgarh. In December 1788, a month after his arrival, Wood was 



26 

with a detachment of three battalions and artillery, which marched to 
Anupshahr for the protection of the northern dominions of the Nawab 
Vizier. They remained there in camp for seven months, and returned to 
Fatehgarh, when the Ganges rose. Before going off, however, he had 
made a very agreeable trip to Agra, Muttra and Delhi, as one of a party 
of tourists. It may well be surmised that this was one of the usual 
diversions of the Fatehgarh garrison. The party was a large one includ- 
ing Colonel Briscoe, General Carnac (2nd in Command at Plassey. Died 
at Mangalore in 1800, aged 84), Major Smith and Sons (commanded the 
14th Battalion. Died 1794), Melville (a Civilian and Paymaster), and a 
number of others the most notable of whom were the two Daniells, the 
artists. An escort of Iwo companies of sepoys and a body of cavalry 
went with them. About the hot weather he writes, " I never experienced 
the heat so oppressive as this season. Luckily it did not last long. The 
thermometer when exposed to the sun on the 3rd June was 142, in the 
shade 112. The following morning at 3 o'clock we were much alarmed 
with a violent shock of an earthquake, but no mischief done ". He 
gives the amount of his pay as being nearly Rs. 400 per mensem, on 
field batta. The system in vogue of relieving troops annually made the 
officers, he said, very uncomfortable. 

The artists, Thomas and his nephew William Daniells, visited Fateh- 
garh in 1789 during their tour around India. William wrote a diary, 
which has never been published, but extracts relating to Fatehgarh have 
been kindly communicated by Sir Evan Cotton. In volume 45 of 
" Bengal, Past and Present ", Sir Evan Cotton has given a full account 
of the Daniells. From the diary it is clear they were at Fatehgarh from 
the 1st to 10th January 1789, and a second time from the 1st to 17th 
June. There are no views of Fatehgarh among their sketches, but there 
are several of " Cannouge ", or Kan au j, from the Ganges. The part of 
the diary which relates to Fatehgarh begins with the entry for 1st January 
1789. "Left Cawnpore abt. i of 12 a. m. in our palanquins for Futty 
Ghur where we arrived abt. 10 p. m. Were put down at Col. 
Brisco's. Found no body at home. However took the liberty of taking 
possession of the couches in the Bungalow for the night.

Guernsey 1801) soon after arrived who received us also very politely. 
Were introduced to him by Colonel B. Mr. Melvil (Melville, Bengal Civil 
Service. Paymaster to troops) invited us to dinner who we accordingly 
waited on. Spent the evening with Captain Scott. (Captain 3rd 
Battalion Artillery. Died at Dinapore, 1802). 

Jan. 3. Dined with Mr. Baillie (L. Baillie. Lieutenant, 1st Cavalry. 
Lost on the voyage to India on the "Skelton Castle" in 1806). It rained

and party went on Board their Boats after supper. 

Jan. 6. Un. writing letters most part of the day. Myself employed 
making a view of Colonel Brisco's Bungalow which I nearly completed by 
Dinner. In the evening Colonel B., General C. (John Carnac who was 
visiting Fatehgarh), Mr. Brown (G. S. Brown. Lieutenant. A. D. C. to 
Colonel Briscoe. Afterwards Lieutenant-General and K. C. B. Died at

Jan. 9. Looking over Gilchrist most of the day, Un. over Hadley 
(both Hindustani grammars). Supped with Captain Fawcett (Brigade 
Major 5th Brigade. Died in England 1823) who is to accompany us to 
Furruckabad to-morrow. 

Jan. 10. We set off very early this morning for Furruckabad. 
Un. went with Captain Fawcett in Captain F's Phaton and I drove one of 
Colonel B's Buggys. Breakfasted in a garden close to the largest tomb (of 
Nawab Mohammed Khan, by the Mau gate of the City) at Furruckabad. 
After breakfast went into the town and looked at two or three more 
Mosques of a curious kind. Returned about 11 o.c. near the Tomb 
where we had breakfasted and made two or three drawings of it. Dined 
by the Tomb and returned to Futty Ghur abt. Sunset. 

Jan. 11. We went on Col. Briseo's elephant to Furruckabad with 
an intention of seeing the Fort. Sent on an Harcarrah to inform the 
Nawaub of our arrival. Waited in a Mosque near two hours when the 
Harcarrah brought back word that the Nawab was asleep and if we 
would wait till he awoke we might then have a permit to see the Fort. 
This answer made us mount the elephant and return to Futty Ghur, but 
soon after we left Farruckabad an Harcarrah came and informed us that 
the Nawab was awake and would grant us a permit to see the Fort. 
However his ungentleman like behaviour induced us to keep on but we 
sent our Salaams and would wait on him another morning. Dined with 
Captain Scott in the evening. 

January 12. Busy packing up all day. Dined with Captain 
Scrimshere (John Scrymgeour. Brigade Major 4th Brigade. Died in

and came to the ground where the tents were pitched (at Mohamdabad) 
about i_ after 8. Distant from Futty Ghur by the Perambulator 14* 
miles, (a large wheel, trundled by a handle with a clock work attachment 
and a dial, which recorded the revolutions, and so measured the 
distances). We came on two of the Colonel's elephants. Un. in the 
Umaree myself in the Houda. The face of the country from Futty 
Ghur to Mohamedabad is flat, but beautiful groves of trees are every- 



20 

where scattered about. After breakfast we walked to the Fort of 
Mohamedabad built by Mohamed Khan, grandfather to the present 
Nawaub of Furruckabad (Mazaffar Jang) abt. 70 years ago. We made 
a few sketches of it. In the evening I made a general view of Camp. 

January 14. Started abt. an hour before sunrise and came in 
our camp at Begur (Bewar) at 9 o.c, distant from Mohamedabad 11 
miles." 

Colonel John White was sent from Dinapore to take up the 
command at Fatehgarh in 1790. He was a very senior officer. It is 
not known when he obtained a cadetship. Major Hodson gives his 
list of services as follows — Lieutenant in 1759, and full Colonel in 1 7 8 ( j . 
The old 12th N. L, which he raised nt Monghyr in 1763 as the 15th 
Battalion, was called after him " Hote-ki-paltan." The campaign against 
the Rajah of Benares in 1781 was the only active service which he saw. 
He died in 1794, and his grave is to be seen in the old cemetery below 
Chunar Fort. At the end of his holding the command he incurred the 
displeasure of the Commander-in-Chief. In the eighteenth century the 
Husainpur and Sudder Bazar were looked after by on official called the 
"Commissary of Bazars", and later a warrant officer on the Town 
Majors' list was entrusted with the same work. In 1792 Robert Grant, 
whose infant son is buried in the Fort cemetery, was Paymaster to the 
troops at Fatehgarh and Cawnpore, and Superintendent of Bazar Duties. 

This was his official title, but more commonly he was known as the 
Bazar Commissary, and had a number of underlings who carried out 
his orders. He was in Fatehgarh in 1787, and still working in the 
same capacity eleven years afterwards. A Government Order of 1787 
forbade Commanding Officers to give orders to the Bazar Chaudhries 
except through the Commissary. Colonel White directed the bazar 
servants to attend at his house on every occasion on which he summoned 
them by an orderly. The Kotwal, taking no notice, was promptly 
punished without any reference being made to the Commissary, Mr. Grant. 
A report by Mr. Grant went up to the Commander-in-Chief, Lord 
Cornwallis, who on the 1st October 1792 published a strong censure of 
Colonel White's conduct, and remarked that " however painful it may be 



3U 

to the Commander-in-Chief to take notice of the misconduct of officers 
of the highest rank in the army, yet he feels it to be an indispensable 
duty to take care that no rank or station shall protect a man from the 
censure or punishment, merited by an attempt to counteract the regula- 
tions, which are calculated to suppress abuses, which had long disgraced 
the Bengal Army, and degraded the character of the principal officers." 
Lord Cornwallis went on to say that he had perused the report against 
Colonel White with sentiments of the highest disapprobation, and directed 
him to pay a fine of one thousand rupees, which sum was to be presented 
to the Kotwal of the bazar as compensation. 

The Officers Commanding, who from 1792 onwards had charge of 
the garrison, until in 1805 Fatehgarh ceased to be the headquarters of a 
brigade, were all notable men, and reached high rank in the Army. 
During this period the garrison attained its greatest limits. The civil 
population increasing at a great rate, the number of residents made up 
a bigger total than ever before, or afterwards.. The three visitors, who 
left record of their stay at Fatehgarh between these years, were the 
young Civilian, Thomas Twining, whose "Travels in India 100 years 
ago " is most entertaining work, Viscount Valentia, and Lieutenant John 
Pester. Poster's diary has been published under the title of " War and 
Sport in India," It is intensely interesting for the latter part of the 
period." 

Colonel Charles Morgan (1742-1819), like several of his 
predecessors, was transferred to the Bengal Army from a British 
regiment, which in this case was the 5th Foot. Major Hodson gives his 
services as Ensign in the 53rd Foot in 1759,. then with the 5th Foot until 
1765. After being dismissed and re-admitted to the Bengal Army, 
he was Q. M. G. and contractor for boats, and going through the 1st 
Mahratta War brought the Bengal detachment back from Bombay to 
Cawnpore in 1782-84, after taking over command from Goddard. He 
commanded the force assembled in 1797 to resist the advance of the 
Afghans into the Punjab, a force to which the Fatehgarh garrison sent 
a contingent. He retired in 1803, and died in Portland Place, London, 
in 1819. 



31 

The great event of 1794. was the battle of Bitaurah on the 26th 
October. Twining describes the eve of the Rohilla War. He arrived 
at Fatehgarh by river with Sir Robert Abercrombie, the Commander-in- 
Chief, who was supposed to be inspecting the Company's stations up 
country. Twining moved into a small bungalow, the verandah of which 
directly overlooked the Ganges, and was on the site of No. 9. Here 
one day he saw a European soldier, slowly swimming downstream in 
order to commit suicide. After being royally entertained for a week, 
the Commander-in-Chief without warning suddenly ordered mobilisation 
for the Rohilla campaign. In a few days, on the 18th October, the 
troops marched across the Ganges from the Fort ghat, Twining seeing 
them off and saying good-bye to Captain Ramsay, who commanded the 
cavalry force. The 10th, 12th, 14th, and 18th Battalions N. I . , and 
Captain Hardwicke's Company from the 3rd artillery battalion, formed 
the column together with the two regiments of cavalry under Ramsay. 
Junction was made with the 2nd European Battalion and six others of 
the Native Infantry from Cawnpore. The whole force advanced into 
Rohilkhand until contact was made with the Rohilla Army at Bitaurah 
in the Bareilly District. The column erected by order of the Governor- 
General in Council, which marks the battle field and resting place of 
the killed, can be seen from the train, as it proceeds towards Ram pur 
from Bareilly. In the small cemetery at that spot lie the remains of 
the officers and men of the Fatehgarh Brigade, who lost their lives in 
one of the hardest fought actions of the century. 

A letter dated " Camp Rampore, 26th October 1794," printed in 
the Calcutta Gazette, is worth reproducing for the vivid picture it gives 
of the battle and the praise bestowed on the 18th Battalion from Fateh- 
garh. Officers of the 7th Rajput Regiment will be no less interested in 
the writer, who afterwards was known as Lieutenant-General Sir John 
Macdonald, K. C. B. He raised the present 1st Battalion (then 15th 
N. I.) of the 7th Rajput Regiment in 1798. He commanded the 2nd 
European Regiment in the battle, having the 18th Battalion from Fateh- 
garh on his left and the 13th Battalion on his right. All three 
Battalions had great reputations, and were picked to form the Reserve. 



32 

He wrote as follows: — " The whole line was ordered to be under arms 
this morning, an hour before daylight; the General and his Staff moved 
to reconnoitre some miles in front; they saw the enemy forming in full 
force ; and after waiting some time to judge of the probable disposition 
they would take, rode back to camp to direct the arrangement for action. 
Our army moved forward in line, the art. in the intervals of corps, the 
cav. on the right flank; the charge of the enemy was most daring and 
gallant, and it is utterly impossible it could have been surpassed: both 
lines met and intermingled. The bayonet at length prevailed, and our 
army pursued the enemy across the Doojoora rivulet. The enemy was 
said to have consisted of 25,000 men, of which 4,000 were cav. who 
directed all their efforts against the reserve, and made dreadful execution. 
The number of the enemy killed was great. Our loss in European- 
officers was very afflicting. Maj. Bolton commanded the 18th batt. 
He was a remarkable large, powerful man. His batt. behaved with 
a degree of steadiness which would have done credit to the most 
disciplined corps in the world/ 1 

" The charge on the part of the enemy was particularly singular; 
they formed in line, infinitely beyond the extent of ours, in deep wedges, 
supposed of 50 deep. When the signal for our advancing was given, we 
moved in good order, slowly forward, at that time about 1,200 yards 
from the enemy. They likewise moved towards us. When the lines 
were within 500 yards of each other, Gholam Mahomed's people scattered 
individually, approached in that extraordinary manner, and contested 
the point with our bayonets. They appeared to despise our musketry ; 
and upon every discharge of art. embraced the ground, instantly rising 
again and advancing to the charge: their arms were spears, matchlocks, 
and swords; which latter, they employed to destructive effect, and their 
attack, as if by universal consent, was called the Highland Charge." 

The casualties were 14 British officers, and 600 rank and file. 
Lieutenant Wells of the 14th, Lieutenant Cummings, and Major Bolton 
of the 18th Battalion were killed. The 14th and 18th suffered heavy 
losses, while the cavalry was cut to pieces. Twining describes the 
distress in Fatehgarh, where the officers who were killed, had left 



33 

families. The disaster, too, which had caused these heavy losses, was 
due to a Fatehgarh officer. At the commencement of the action Captain 
Ramsay with his two cavalry regiments was ordered to take position on 
the right of the Reserve, and in a line with the infantry. Without having 
received any orders he wheeled his cavalry to the left by half ranks. 
By this faulty movement he led his men into the rear of the infantry. 
The cavalry fell into disorder, and was charged in flank by the Rohilla 
horsemen. Ramsay failed to rally his men, and indeed after the battle he 
was charged with not having even attempted to do so. The line of the 
13th Battalion was broken. In a very short time its Officer Commanding 
and 4 other officers were killed. This Battalion had been at Fatehgarh 
eight years before, and its commander, Captain Macleod, was known 
there. 

There was some sympathy felt for Ramsay in the camp. Letters to 
Headquarters dwell upon his good services in all the campaigns under 
General Goddard. The Commander-in-Chief received Ramsay's resigna- 
tion in December, but the Board would not accept it. In the hopes of 
softening their hearts, Ramsay drafted a long essay on the subject of 
improving the breed of horses in Oudh, which on the 26th January the 
Board refused to consider at all, since it was hardly germane to the subject of 
Ramsay's misconduct! Meanwhile on the 9th January the Commander-in- 
Chief ordered Ramsay to be tried at Cawnpore. It is said that Ramsay 
then absconded rather than face the court-martial. That of course is 
true, but the records do not show that there was any hurry about it. 
Ramsay just departed quite openly, and it is very likely that the 
authorities connived at his leaving the country. Major Hodson gives 
the following interesting account of Ramsay's after life. " According 
to one account, he afterwards entered the French service, and served 
under Napoleon as a Commissariat Officer. Hickey, however, states that 
two years after his escape from close arrest he was seen and recognised in 
Scotland, where he was residing under an assumed name. Major Archer 
writes — the officer who thus acquired a deathless infamy is still (December 
1828) alive, and recently resided on the Continent. Thomas Edwards 
(died 1815) stated he saw him at his residence near Brussels, but does 



84 

not give the date. He was living in or near Brussels with his family 
from 1805 till 1816 or later." Ramsay was a son-in-law of Samuel 
Skardon, the Deputy Commissary of Ordnance, who is buried in the Fort 
cemetery (see Chapter V). The tablet, now affixed to the cemetery wall, 
records that the tomb was erected by him. In spite of Ramsay's past 
history, hi3 son John Skardon Ramsay was allowed to enter the Bombay 
Army in 1819. 

After Colonel Morgan, one of the most famous officers of the Bengal 
Army commanded at Fatehgarh in the person of Colonel William 
Popham (1740-1821). His services as given by Major Hodson are long 
and varied. His capture of Gwalior by escalade is an exploit which 
finds mention in every history book, and Fatehgarh could not ha A e 
obtained at any time a more distinguished commander than thus brilliant 
soldier. After starting as an Ensign in the 24th Foot in 1757, Popham 
was transferred to the 64th (79th), and accompanied it to the siege and 
capture of Manila in 1762. As Captain in the lf3th Foot he sold out in 
1768. In the same year he entered the Indian service, obtaining the com- 
mand in Cooch Behar after a few years. In the 1st Mahratta war he 
commanded the 2nd N. I. with the Bombay detachment under Goddard. 
At the end of 1779 he was sent with a force to assist the Rana of Gohad 
against the Mahrattas. Then followed the capture of Lahar Fort, the 
storming of Gwalior, the campaign against the Rajah of Benares,the capture 
of Bijaigarh in Central India, election as M .P. for Milborne Port, Somerset, 
when on furlough from 1787-1790, and in the last year a defeat at the elec- 
tion for Queensboro'. On return to India at the end of 1794 the appointment 
to Fatehgarh was made. The only report by Popham was one describing 
a very severe thunderstorm, which broke over the Station on the 15th 
May 1795, causing a great deal of damage to the Cavalry Lines at Rakha 
and blowing off the thatched roofs of the hospital and several bungalows. 
The artillery barracks outside the Fort were built in his time. There 
was some activity in repairing houses in Cantonments and Government 
buildings. Meanwhile a very serious situation had come into being in 
the garrison, of which Popham had made no report to the Commander-in- 
Chief at all. Throughout the year 1795 the officers of the Bengal Army 



35 

were in a state of ferment in all the stations of Upper Bengal, the 
discontent being most marked at Fatehgarh and Cawnpore. It was noted 
by the Governor-General, Sir John Shore, that the officers of the Fateh- 
garh garrison were the most violent in their sentiments. This episode of 
1795-96, the outbreak of disputes in the Army which almost ended in a 
mutiny, has been little noticed in histories of India, or where noticed it 
has been exaggerated. The military records at the India office, so far as 
Fatehgarh is concerned, give little indication of it. Popham's reports in 
1795 deal entirely with routine matters. Captain Bullock, in reviewing 
Furber's " Private Record of an Indian Governor-Generalship " in the 
Statesman of the 8th October 1933, has drawn attention to this little 
known chapter of army history; and the book is worth reading, not only 
for its general contents, but also because Fatehgarh is involved as being 
the chief focus of discontent at the time. 

Furber points out that in 1794 the Company's officers had little 
hope of rising to the higher ranks. Only 52 out of about 1,000 infantry 
officers could look forward to fteld-officers' rtink. In addition, if the 
officer was fortunate to survive he could only expect a small retiring 
pension from Lord Clive's fund. He had to resign his commission, if he 
went to England. His pay, too, was slender. It will be remembered 
that Major Whinyates only drew Rs. 450 monthly for being a Brigade 
Staff Officer, and was greatly in debt. An officer in those days had to 
add to his pay by allowances called bhatla, by receipts of Bazar money, 
or payments by Cantonment shopkeepers, or by juggling with regimental 
allowances and contracts, of which the less said the better. An added 
source of ill-humour was created by friction with the officers of the King's 
troops, who out-ranked those of the Company of the same grade. Through- 
out the year 1795 the East India Company debated on the necessity for 
revising the regulations. The Bengal officers had their agents in England, 
and there was no lack of insistence on the need for reform in speeding up 
promotion and providing for furlough and better pay. Meanwhile the 
Governor-General, Sir John Shore, had patiently to wait for the result of 
the Company's procrastination, and try to allay the bitter feeling aroused 
by the Company's tactics among the officers in India, who were also afraid 



36 

of being transferred in a body to the King's Service without being 
consulted. This had, in fact, been a serious proposal of the preceding 
Governor-General, Lord Cornwallis, and when made public in the spring 
of 1795, it only increased the existing discontent. At the end of 1795 
no definite orders having arrived from England, the situation became 
alarming. 

In February 1796, Sir John Shore wrote to the President of the 
Government Board of Control in England, who was more or less the then 
Secretary of State for India, that the officers at Fatehgarh were more 
unanimous in adopting violent resolutions than those at Cawnpore. He 
wrote that "amongst other propositions which have been agitated are the 
following. A resolution to throw off all allegiance to Government in 
March, if the Regulations should not arrive by that time, and the seizure 
of the Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief, and to compel by 
force of arms all to join them, with many others equally treasonable. 1 
am told that the first resolution was adopted at Futtygurh at a meeting 
of fifty officers, with only two dissenting voices." He gave his opinion 
that he did not think the Fatehgarh officers were prepared to take over 
command of the Army. He wrote, however, to the Governor of Madras 
for reinforcements and to the Governor at the Cape. Sir Robert Aber- 
cromby, the Commander-in-Chief was sent up country on the 20th January 
1796 to assert Government's authority, and his success at Cawnpore 
damped the spirits of the complainants at Fatehgarh and other canton- 
ments. It appeared that all the officers at Fatehgarh and the Infantry 
officers at Cawnpore had drawn up a revolutionary constitution of Army 
Committees to enforce their resolutions. The artillery officers at Calcutta, 
however, refused to acquiesce, and there was a strong minority of dissen- 
tients at Cawnpore. This lack of unanimity strengthened the Commander- 
in-Chief's hands. The army regulations appeared in the course of 1796, 
and everything objectionable in them being altered by the Governor- 
General on his own authority, peace was eventually restored. In 1796 
at all events the Officer Commanding at Fatehgarh, Major-General Robert 
Stuart, was in close touch with the Governor-General, and he must have 
done much to control the malcontents in the garrison; for Popham had 



37 

gone by 1796, and in his place a Colonel W. Jones took over the com- 
mand temporarily, until the arrival of the permanent commander. It was 
probably during the change of command that the officers of the garrison 
got out of control. The units then serving at Fatehgarh were the 1st 
Regiment of Cavalry ; two companies of the 3rd Battalion of Artillery ; 
the 12th, 14th, 17th, and 21st Battalions of Native Infantry. 

On the 3rd of October 1795 Colonel Popham and sixty-eight officers 
at Fatehgarh sent a "Congratulatory Address to Warren Hastings Esqr., 
on his acquittal of the charges preferred against him by the Commons of 
Great Britain" in the following terms : 
Sir, 

The officers and staff of that part of the Bengal Army at present 
stationed at Futty Ghur would deem themselves deficient in gratitude 
for the steady support afforded to their claims and the warm regard 
invariably manifested for the honour and prosperity of the Army in 
general, during your administration of British affairs in India, should 
they not embrace the earliest opportunity of presenting to you their 
sincere congratulations upon the honourable termination of the long 
and rigorous scrutiny which has been instituted into your measures 
and conduct during a government of thirteen years, and under the 
constant pressure of multiplied difficulties and dangers. 

While they testify their inexpressible satisfaction at the result of 
an enquiry, which will transmit your name to posterity with deserved 
and unfadcd lustre, they cannot but feel a very particular self- 
gratulation on finding their own sentiments of your wisdom, zeal and 
important public services, confirmed by the almost unanimous verdict 
of the most respectable tribunal upon earth, and the general voice of 
the nation. 

May you, Sir, long live in the enjoyment of your well-earned fame, 

and in the perfect possession and further public exertion of those 

eminent talents, which have acquired such extensive and permanent 

advantage to your country." 

Warren Hastings wrote a special letter of acknowledgement to Colonel 

Popham; and it appears from a letter which he sent to Major-General 



3 8 

Morgan, the Commander-in-Chief in Bengal, that he had received similar 
addresses from all other military stations. 

Popham came to the fore again in 1799, when the command of a 
column, which went to Madras by sea in order to take part in the 4th 
Mysore War, was given to him. This detachment from Bengal assisted 
at the storming of Seringapatam, Popham being a Major-General com- 
manding the Left Wing of the Army. Retirement came in 1803, and 
Popham died in York Street, London, in 1821. 

Mention has already been made of the Captain Rawstorne of the 28th 
Battalion in the Temporary Brigade, who witnessed the progress of Fateh- 
garh from a camp of tents to a well arranged cantonment. Iu 1781 
Rawstorne had been Commanding Officer for a short period, and he was 
now to take up that appointment for a second time. In 1797 Rawstorne 
was at Cawnpore with the 2nd Bengal European Regiment. On the 24th 
June he arrived by river at Fatehgarh, and held the command until the 
end of the year, when Major-General Robert Stuart relieved him. His 
days were chiefly spent in building, and renewing the Lines. The cavalry 
stables at Rakha had as usual to be patched up. The District was quiet, 
and indigo planters and traders, by penetrating to every part of it, were 
creating a good deal of employment, which helped to bring about more 
settled conditions. The military population of Cantonments was still 
numerous. An address to the Commander-in-Chief, dated the 19th 
February 1796, was signed by 49 officers and surgeons. Two years later 
Major-General R. Stuart wrote to the Commander-in-Chief that the Indian 
officers and men of the garrison desired to contribute towards the main- 
tenance of the war, then being waged by Great Britain in Europe. A 
list of subscribers to the national funds for the prosecution of this war with 
the French was published in the Asiatic Annual Register for 1799, and 
in it will be found the names of all the military residents, many of whom 
gave remarkably large sums. The rupee in 1799 was worth half a crown 
in English currency, and its purchasing value also was far greatei than that 
of the present day rupee. The account of the proceedings is as follows: 

" At a meeting of the Officers and Staff of the station of Futty Ghur, 
assembled at the request of Major-General Stuart, on the 1st July 1798, 



89 

the officers assembled elected Major-General Stuart to be president of the 
meeting, and Captain Alex. Orme to be secretary. 

The meeting having taken into account the state of the mother 

country, they further resolved, to the utmost of their 

means, to give pecuniary aid to the national Government; for which 
purpose a subscription will be opened at the Brigade Major's office (No. % 
Bungalow), where gentlemen may subscribe in the manner most convenient 
and agreeable to themselves.' 

Major-General Robert Stuart headed the list with a munificent 
donation of 8,000 sicca rupees. Major R. Frith, commanding the 1st 
Regiment of Cavalry at Rakha gave 1,000 sicca rupees. Lt.- Colonel R. 
Rane, commanding the I/6th N. I . , gave Rs. 1,500, and Major G. Wood, 
commanding the other battalion of the 6th N.I ., gave Rs. 1,000. Captain 
Orme, the Brigade Major, put himself down for Rs. 1,000. Forty-seven 
other officers and two merchants, Laurence Paul and J. P. Bellow (or 
Bellew) , gave amounts varying from Rs. 25 monthly to Rs. 1,000. The 
total sum came to over Rs. 22,000. 

The only troops, which left Fatehgarh in 1797, were those sent to 
Lucknow to help the Resident, and the same detachment marched the 
next year to Rampur in Rohilkhand to help the Governor of that area to 
quell some disturbances. In the last year of the century it looked as if 
the Fatehgarh Brigade would again go on active service. Zaman Shah 
of Kabul threatened to invade the Punjab. The nearest danger point for 
the Nawab Vizier was Anupshahr on the Ganges, a place well known to 
the Fatehgarh troops and well loathed by them. Concentration of all 
available troops in this direction was ordered to meet the threat. An 
army under Sir James Craig came up to Fatehgarh from Cawnpore, and 
after taking with it the Fatehgarh Brigade marched to Anupshahr via 
Kaimganj. The Army was accompanied by a Chaplain named Tennant, 
who wrote a description of the march. Unfortunately he has nothing to 
say about Fatehgarh, and its appearance in 1799. His observations on 
the social habits of officers at Cawnpore apply, however, to Fatehgarh, 
since there was the closest connection between the two places. Bungalows, 
he notes, had much improved in comfort since 1788. Beef, mutton, and 



40 

poultry were being eaten, and dinner took place in the evening instead of 
at 2 p. m., an hour which had necessarily entailed a long siesta after ft. 
Pester mentions that dinner at Fatehgarh in 1803 was in the evening. 
Drinking and gaming up to the small hours were the only evening amuse- 
ments. The same writer says that men sometimes took so much claret after 
dinner that they were unable to join the ladies, and guests used to spend 
the night in the bungalow of their host, either on the floor, or on sofas. 
Among the pictures at Government House, Allahabad, writes Sir 
Evan Cotton in an article called " The Kidnapped Colonel ", which was 
published in the Statesman, there is a portrait of a certain Colonel Stewart. 
This portrait formerly belonged to the famous Begum Somru of Sardhana, 
near Meerut. The Colonel, whose name is rightly Robert Stuart (1744- 
1820) , was the Officer Commanding Fatehgarh in 1796. In 1776 he 
raised the 21st Battalion for the Nawab Vizier, and just escaped being 
stationed at Fatehgarh with the Temporary Brigade, the battalions of 
which started with No. 22. It was in 1791, when serving on the frontier 
at Anupshahr, that he was captured by a Sikh chief during an early 
morning ride. His release was obtained through the Begum Somru, who 
paid a ransom of Rs. 15,000 for him. which was refunded to her by 
Government in 1792, and the Governer-General sent her a letter of thanks 
for her "laudable exertions". Stuart was also at Fatehgarh from 1797 
to 1802. He retired the next year, and died at Annat Lodge, near Perth, 
in 1820. 

The contribution of the Nawab Vizier of Oudh towards the main- 
tenance of the Company's troops in his territory was twenty-three lakhs 
of rupees annually. Payment was long in arrears. In January 1801 
Nawab Saadat AM, unable to pay the vast sums which had accumulated 
through the mismanagement of his predecessors, ceded the Gorakhpur 
and Rohilkhand Divisions and the Duab to the East India Company, to 
provide permanently for the cost of the Company's troops in Oudh and 
on its frontier at Fatehgarh. The local Nawab at Farrukhabad, Nasir- 
i-Jang, also came to an arrangement with the Company, and by treaty 
gave up sovereign rights over the district in return for a settled income. 
These treaties entailed a change in the status of Fatehgarh, the Civil 



41 

Station of which was now bound to come into existence with the advent 
of the Company's officials. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, 
therefore, Fatehgarh was concerned less with military operations, and 
more with the establishment of an administration on the lines of the 
older Bengal districts. In 1801, it is true, a detachment of troops went 
to Bareilly to deal with mutinous Oudh troops, but otherwise for the 
next year or two until the Mahratta War, the troops were engaged in 
assisting the Civil Authorities to collect revenue from the unwilling 
occupants of numerous mud forts, in territory now included in the Etah 
and Etawah Districts, as well as the present District of Farrukbabad. 
The country transferred by Nawab Saadat AM was called the Ceded 
Districts. Henry Wellesley, afterwards known as Lord Cowley, a 
brother of the then Governor-General, was appointed Lieutenant- 
Governor with his seat of administration at Bareilly. Fatehgarh 
assumed some importance in the Governor-General's estimation. 
Undoubtedly the treaty with the Bangash Nawab, Nasir-i-Jang, which 
had been concluded the year before, came under his consideration. A 
great deal of trouble was created for Lord Wellesley, at any rate, by 
allegations that he had oppressed the Nawab. Lord Wellesley had tried 
at Luck now to dislodge all European traders who were not the Company's 
servants, and drive them out of Oudh. They were mostly persons of 
doubtful antecedents, bent on making a fortune. Their leader was an 
adventurer named James Pan II with extensive business connections at 
Lucknow. Paull stood up to the Governor-General, and fought him 
unavailingly. He never forgave Wellesley, and returning to England 
bought a seat in Parliament in 1805. Paull's only work as a legislator 
was to attempt to impeach Lord Wellesley of what he considered were 
misdemeanours in his Indian administration. In one of the charges 
relating to alleged bad treatment of Nawab Nasir-i-Jang, Fatehgarh 
came in for considerable mention. 

The first official to set up his office in Fatehgarh was the acting 
Agent to the Governor-General, who was invested with the powers of a 
revenue and political Agent by Government Order of the 2nd June 1802. 
Graeme Mercer, an Assistant Surgeon, was the first. He had perforce to 



42 

work in Cantonments, since there was no Civil Station then in existence. 
There are indications in the earliest records that civil officials first set 
up their residences at Kasim Bagh, and in the area now occupied by the 
B. B. and C. I. Railway Quarters and Engine Shed. This area was 
just outside Cantonments. It lay conveniently with reference to the 
City, and speedy communication with the Nawab. In 1806 Mercer was 
appointed Resident at Scindia's Court. He retired in 1814, dying 
twenty seven years later in Scotland. 

The first year of Fatehgarh under the new regime was a disturbed 
one. A severe famine raged throughout the district. The Mahrattas 
were pouring over Etah and Mainpuri. A large body of them took up 
a position in the Patiali jungles, from which they threatened an invasion 
of Fatehgarh. Although the troops did not have to move out, Major- 
General Ware was alert. Mr. Grant, the first Magistrate, attempted 
to round up these stray Mahrattas at Patiali. Operations were not 
successful, but the Mahrattas were frightened, and the object of keeping 
them away from Farrukhabad territory was gained. In the midst 
of these pre-occupations, Mr. Grant had to receive at his house a 
distinguished tourist in the person of Viscount Valentia, who descended 
upon him from Lucknow. Lord Valentia's experiences were described 
in a work called " Travels in India," which appeared in 1806. It is a 
work which gives a good deal of information about places other than 
Fatehgarh. The City of Farrukhabad is praised for its fine trees and 
gardens, but no description of the Cantonment is given, and there is no 
clue to enable a guess being made at the situation of Mr. Grant's 
bungalow. All that Lord Valentia says is that " by seven I reached 
my friend Mr. Grant, who is Judge of the district. Mr. Webb 
(2/10th N. I.) by directions of Major-General Ware pitched our tents 
close to the garden fence." Grant appears to have been a most efficient 
officer, and a very popular man. Lord Valentia thought very highly of 
him, as did the second Agent to the Governor-General, Claud Russell. 
His death in 1804 was a great loss to the administration. 

Lieutenant John Pester (1778-1856) l/2nd N. I . , the author of the 
diary published in 1913 under the title " War and Sport in India " went 



43 

on leave to Fatehgarh in 1803, 1804 and 1805, for several visits to his 
friends there. Pester eventually became Lieutenant-Colonel of the 13th 
N. I . , and retired in 1826 after serving through the 2nd and 3rd Mahratta 
Wars. He died at Millbrook, near Southampton, in 1856. He came 
to the Station first on the 25th May 1803, staying with his friend 
Wemyss (James Wemyss, B. C. S. Register or Assistant to the Judge), 
who took him to the theatre at 10 p. m. to see a play performed by 
gentlemen, which proved to be " She Stoops to Conquer." On this 
visit he called on General Ware, but no hint is given as to where exactly 
in Cantonments the General lived. His next visit was on the 12th July 
1804 on his way from Gwalior to Bareiily. This time he stayed with his 
friend Christie (Captain 2nd N. I. Brigade-Major at Fatehgarh), for 
Wemyss had been transferred to Cawnpore. Christie's bungalow was 
on the banks of the Ganges. This description unfortunately is too vague 
to allow of any identification. He writes, " Sent immediately for some 
cloth and purchased a sufficiency to make a dozen suits. Fmployed all 
the tailors that could be found. The weather very cool, and the old 
Ganges afforded a very gratifying sight." The third visit was on the 
16th June 1805, this time on sick leave from Agra to Bareiily. He 
stayed till the 21st. On the 17th he writes, " Breakfasted and dined 
to-day at Paton's (Assistant Magistrate). Met there an old acquaintance 
of mine, Mrs. B. a nice little widow with a lac of rupees." The following 
day he called on Captain Christie's widow, " who I had not seen since 
the death of my poor friend Christie ; my having been in continual habits 
of friendship with Christie, recalled past events to her remembrance, and 
she appeared much distressed at first." He dined with the Commanding 
Officer, Colonel Richard Macan, and also with the officers of the 27th 
Light Dragoons, at Rakha Cantonment. 

Seven battalions were raised at Fatehgarh in the years 1803 and 
1804. Details of them are given in Appendix IL A letter, dated the 
5th June 1804, sent by a Fatehgarh correspondent to the Calcutta 
Gazette, describes the kind of ceremony, which was observed when the 
newly raised corps were deemed to be perfectly formed, and worthy of 
receiving their colours : " Yesterday, the anniversary of His Majesty's 



te 

birthday,"* says the writer, "the 22nd Regiment Native Infantry received 
their colours from the hands of Lieutenant-Colonel Kyan, Commanding the 
Regiment and Station ; the Regiment paraded a little before sunset, in 
full uniform, when Lieutenant-Colonel Kyan took post in front of the 
centre of the Corps, and presented the colours of each Battalion to Major 
Ralph and Captain Pry or, the Officers Commanding. The ceremony of 
receiving and saluting the colours being over, each Battalion fired three 
vollies iu honour of the birthday of our gracious Sovereign, which were 
performed remarkably well, and with the greatest steadiness. This new 
Corps, so lately levied, made a very respectable appearance, and were 
extremely steady under arms. In the evening an elegant entertainment 
was given by Lieutenant-Colonel Kyan, and many loyal and appropriate 
toasts were drunk." The 1st Battalion of this regiment, which received 
its first colours that day on the Fatehgarh parade ground, is still in 
existence. It is now known as the 1st RoyalfTMtalion (Light Infantry) 
9th J at Regiment. 

Colonel Macan (died 1812) was the last Brigade Commander of 
Fatehgarh, for after 1805 Fatehgarh ceased to be headquarters of a 
brigade, and the garrison was usually one battolion of infantry only. 
Cornet in 1773, he became a Major General in 1808. He died at sea 
in 1812 of fever between Calcutta and St. Helena. In 1781 he was 
transferred from the British Army to the Company's service. He 
commanded the 3rd Cavalry Brigade in the 2nd Mahratta War, and 
took part in all the campaigns of Lords Cornwallis and Lake. Pester 
says of his dinner with Colonel Macan, " Dined with Colonel Macan this 
evening (18th June). Drank more wine than usual, but retired early 
leaving a very large party, who seemed all disposed to do justice to the 
Colonel's excellent claret "! It would seem that the traditions of the 
Officer Commanding the Fatehgarh Brigade were being worthily main- 
tained by the last of them in good eighteenth century fashion. It is a 
matter for regret that no one can now say whereabouts in Fatehgarh 
these convivial meetings took place. The greater part of the troops 
departed with Colonel Macan in 1805. Rakha Cantonment was wholly 
deserted. The infantry barracks, which were not needed, were gradually 



45 

pulled down. Only the lines to the west of the Mall Road were left. 
The avenues of him trees on the edge of the parade ground mark their 
site exactly, and they remained in existence down to the Mutiny. On the 
eastern side of the Mall Road, bungalows quickly arose as soon as the 
old huts could be cleared away. It is known that No. 20 Bungalow was 
built first of all. It was occupied by the Judge Magistrate of the District 
for many years to come, 



CHAPTER II. 

THE SUDDER STATION. 



THE cession of the District by the Nawab of Farrukhabad to the 

1 East India Company took place on the 4th June 1802, and the 
first British officials in the shape of a Judge Magistrate arrived the 
following March. By 1806 the civil establishment was complete, there 
being a Collector, a Register or Assistant to the Judge, a Chaplain and a 
Civil Surgeon in addition to the Judge, who took up also all political 
work in connection with the semi-independent Nawab in the City, and 
was called Agent to the Governor-General in this capacity. Fatehgarh 
was now termed a " Sudder Station ", since it possessed all necessary civil 
officials. It retained its military, importance during the 2nd Mahratta 
War; but after 1806 the Station was commanded by the Officer 
Commanding the battalion of Native Infantry, which happened to be 
stationed in Fatehgarh at the time. The usual garrison was one regiment 
of sepoys, one company of artillery, and a bodyguard for the Commis- 
sioners of the ceded Provinces. The two last named units disappeared by 
1820, and occasionally there appeared special corps, generally irregular 
in formation, which will be noticed in their place. The civil population 
of Cantonments, however, continued to grow. Indigo planters, cotton 
merchants and traders took over the bungalows vacated by military 
officers. The major part of the Infantry Lines had been pulled down. 
The space was covered by new houses, which are represented now by 
Bungalows Nos. 15 to 20. The present Civil Lines came into being and 
the Cantonment was linked up with Rakha. Rakha was abandoned to 
cultivators. The old military bazar became Fatehgarh Town. The area 
immediately in front of the Fort gates was so densely populated, as to 
threaten the forming of another town. The Strand Road was still the 
chief thoroughfare; but the Trunk Road, which formerly in the 
eighteenth century had only been the main road of the Infantry Lines, 
now became a residential quarter. Notwithstanding these alterations, 



47 

the general appearance of Fatehgarh Cantonment was like that of any 
large village to-day. Before 1856 there were no metalled roads. The 
Station was traversed by lanes, just wide enough to allow two carriages to 
pass, seamed with ruts, ankle deep in dust, and after rain impassible 
from mud and water. Compounds were very small, each being surround- 
ed by high mud walls, which contained thatched bungalows resembling 
haystacks, or beehives, according to a contemporary visitor. It seems 
from the records to have been difficult to walk along the roads. The 
residents transported themselves from house to house, either in palanquins, 
or in two-wheeled buggies. The roads, too, were infested by stray dogs, 
and the frequency of mad dogs was a menace, which gave rise to constant 
complaint. Up to 1815 the Magistrate gave notice twice a year that on 
a certain date parties would be sent out to shoot all stray dogs. In 1840 
the Joint Magistrate had to obtain the Commissioner's sanction to destroy 
them. Five years later the Station Staff Officer complained of their 
numbers in Cantonments, and two annas a head had to be offered for 
their destruction. By 1840 the Station had much improved in appearance. 
Metalled roads and more permanent houses of brick and masonry, with 
flat roofs, called kothis, had come into existence, and Fatehgarh began to 
assume its modern aspect. 

The large numbers of pensioners, clerks, and traders, who came 
between 1803 and 1818, together with the indigo planters of the District, 
who desired to have town residences, made the housing problem difficult. 
There was also a considerable Eurasian population, descended from officers 
of the Temporary Brigade and their Mohamedan wives, who occupied a 
great many bungalows on the site of the present Maude Lines, and in the 
Civil Station between the Post Office Road and Machlt Tola. Some 
residents of an undesirable type were in the habit of living in tents, 
which they pitched in odd places. The most scandalous case was that of 
an ex-officer of the 34th N. I . , who had to leave his regiment with 
a constitution broken by hard drinking. He obtained the post of overseer 
in an indigo factory on Rs. 300 a month, but was dismissed for drinking 
in a few weeks. He pitched his tent under a tree near Kasim Bagh. 
His old servant drew his small pension, and expended part on toddy, 



48 

which he used to serve out in rations to his master. On one occasion 
after a lapse of 43 hours, the latter failed to appear from his tent. His 
body was discovered in it, eaten by ants. 

There is no exact evidence of the number of houses during the 
period of the Temporary Brigade. In 1829 a memorial was addressed 
to Government by the civilian residents of Cantonments, which 
gives some indication of the size of the place in that year. The 
cause of the memorial was a station order, dated the 15th October 
1829, issued by Captain Buckley, 70th N. I., (1786-1853. Died 
at Bareilly when commanding the Kohilkhand District). It appears 
that there was a military court functioning at the time, called the Court 
of Request , in which the Officer Commanding took cognisance of claims 
against European residents. Captain Buckley laid down that all civilians, 
failing to appear before this court when required, would be ejected from 
Cantonments. This order produced an agitation, which resulted in the 
drawing up of the memorial. It was shown by the petitioners that in 1829 
there were 70 houses in Cantonments, and 30 outside. The military 
population was only 8 to 10 officers of the regular regiment, 2 belonging 
to the Provincial Battalion, and 3 staff officers, 15 in all at the most. 
When the number of troops decreased in 1806, military officers sold their 
bungalows to indigo planters and cotton merchants. Houses occupied by 
owners were not affected ; but the tenants of numerous other houses were 
ejected without notice by officers, who took a fancy to their residences. 
The Officer Commanding and several other officers were actually living in 
the Civil Lines. One European clerk had been compelled successively 
within three weeks to vacate two houses, which he had taken on rent at 
opposite ends of Fatehgarh. In 1820 Mr. Charter's bungalow in Can- 
tonments was occupied by a clerk, named Hoskins. Captain Hawthorne, 
11th N. I . , (1789-1853, Lieut.-Col. 32nd N. I.), demanded it for himself. 
Hoskins refused to leave, even at the order of Sir Edward Colebrooke, 
the Commissioner, in whose office he was working, and treated Captain 
Hawthorne to much personal abuse. The latter retaliated by going to 
the bungalow with his servants, and throwing Hoskin's furniture on to 
the road, while he was at office. Hoskins appealed to Government, but 



49 

obtained no redress, nor did the memorialists of 1829 fare any better. 
Nothing was done, and military and civilian residents lived where they 
liked. The Officer Commanding refused to move from the compound to 
the south of the present Collector's house. 

The memorial also discloses that the executive officer in Cantonments 
at this date was the Station Staff Officer, who was usually the Adjutant of 
the Provincial Battalion. There was certainly a Cantonment clerk in 1846 ; 
for in that year he was dismissed, and in 1853 there is definite mention of 
a Cantonment Magistrate. Executive orders affecting the station were 
issued by the Officer Commanding. A warrant officer on the Town Major's 
list looked after the Cantonment bazars. There was a Barrack Master in 
charge of military works. He was styled locally " Kot Sahib Captan," 
and appears to have been distinct from the " Kot Master," who lived 
between bungalows Nos. 7 and 9; for both appear in the same list. Kot 
Master was probably Quartermaster; while one suggestion for the 
derivation of Kot Sahib is that it refers to the officer-in-charge of 
" kothis," or Barrack Master. There seems to have been a Barrack 
Master from the earliest period. In 179.5 he was a Major Pringle. He 
was guided by a Committee of Survey, which met to inspect large works, 
and report on the condition of Government buildings annually. The 
members of the Committee were selected from the local garrison ; e. y. in 
1816* Major Stark, Horse Artillery, was President, and Lieutenants 
Thompson and Gairdner, 10th N. I . , were members. 

A list of the regiments stationed at Fatehgarh after 180b' will be 
found in Appendix I. Several of the Commanding Officers and special 
units are of interest. In 1806' the Farrukhabad Provincial Battalion was 
disbanded for the time being. This battalion grew out of an irregular 
force known as a " Sebundy Corps." There was one in Fatehgarh in 
1803. The Sebundy Corps was a kind of militia, which garrisoned forts, 
and performed revenue and police duties at a time when the regular troops 
were away on active service. During the 2nd Mahratta War Fatehgarh 
was denuded of troops, and there being no trained police force, the 
Sebundy Corps was raised to aid the Civil Authorities. The name was 
changed in 1805 to that of the Farrukhabad Provincial Battalion ; mid 



5 

the corps was disbanded in the following year when troops on service 
returned to their cantonments. The first commander was Captain R. Bowie, 
who was Ensign in 1778, and later Captain of the 10th N. I. He served 
in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Mysore Wars, dying at Agra in 1814. He was 
succeeded by Lieutenant A. Oliver, 4th N. I. 

During the Nepal War the Farrukbabad Provincial Battalion was 
re-raised in 1815. The list of its commanders is as follows : — 

1. Lieut. -Col. IV. Cuppaqe. — He entered the service in 1781, 

Served in the 4th Mysore War. Invalided in 1815. Died 
unmarried at Fntehgarh in 1819, aged 58. 

2. Lieut. -Col. Donat V. Kerin — Commanded the battalion from 

1820 to 1822. Born 1758. Died at Patna in 1823. 

3. Lieut. -Col. C. II. Baines. — Commanding 1822 to 1824. Born 

1783. Died 1844. Arrived in India 1799, and served in 
the 2nd Mahfatta and Nepal Wars. 

4. Lieut. -Col. G. Hickman, (1758-1828). — Invalided from the 

1/lstN. I. in 1818. Superintendent of Invalids at Chit- 
tagong. His two sons were Army officers. Died at 
Fatehgarh, and has the largest monument in the Fort 
cemetery. 

5. Lieut-Col. C. Poole, (1777-1843).— 5lst N. I. Invalided in 

1828. Present at the capture of Java in 1811. Commanded 

the battalion until it was disbanded in 1831. He 

continued to reside at Fatehgarh for another three years, 

and became Commandant of Chunar in 1839. He died 

there. 

Thirteen Provincial Battalions came into being, and the local one 

was the ninth. It was not strictly speaking part of the regular army ; 

but in Cantonments it was considered to be under the Officer Commanding 

the regular regiment. This situation arose, because at Fatehgarh the 

Station Staff Officer was the Adjutant of the Provincial Battalion. The 

state for December 1830 shows that there were on civil duties within the 

District 1 Subedar, 2 Jemadars, 16 Hnvildars, 21 Naiks, and 303 Sepoys. 

In addition, there were 214 ranks on civil duty in Mainpuri and Aligarh. 



51 

The rest were in the Lines, or absent on leave. The total was 7 Subedars. 
11 Jemadars, 42 Havildars, 46 Naiks, 9 Drummers, and 681 Sepoys. The 
Adjutant was Lieutenant Duncan (1805-1872). This officer's father was 
General Alex. Duncan (1780-1859), whose marriage took place at 
Fatehgarh in 1802, when he was Adjutant of the 2/2nd N. L In 180(5 he 
was Brigade-Major at Fatehgarh, and his son was probably born in 
Cantonments. Guards were furnished for the Treasury and Cutcherry, 
Escorts were provided for undertrial prisoners going from the Jail to the 
Courts. The sepoys were also employed in helping to collect land revenue. 
One detachment was stationed in Farrukhabad City in 1827 to keep order. 
Another was sent to Kaimganj as a result of fights between the Pathans 
and Banyas. Just before the disbandiuent in 1831 the Magistrate 
reported that the men of this battalion had been assuming an unwarranted 
authority ; and created more squabbles than they prevented. There were 
usually not more than two British officers serving at any time with the 
battalion. It was replaced by barkandazes on Rs. 4 a month. 

Lieut. -Colonel Samuel Palmer, (1762-1814), was commanding in 
1808-9. He commanded the 11th N. I . , and arrived in India in 1779. 
He served through the 2nd Mahratta War, capture of Gohad in 1806, 
capture of Kalinjar 1812, and after commanding at Aligarh in 1813-14 
died at Calcutta. He is referred to in several old records. His successor, 
Lieut. -Colonel Jacob Vanrenan, (1762-1828), was equally respected, and 
left his mark on Cantonments for many years. A regimental bazar was 
laid out in his time, a fragment of which still exists as the B. I . , or Orderly 
Bazar. From 1810 until the Mutiny of 1857 its name, however, was 
Vanrenan Ganj. 

Vanrenan was the son of Daniel van Renan of the Cape. His mother 
also was of Dutch extraction. He had a long and varied service of 46 
years iu India, and was absent for only nine months on sick leave to the 
Cape. On the 8th February 1828 he died on board a boat on the Ganges 
near Cawnpore. The place of burial is not known. He started as a cadet 
in 1780, and was a Lieutenant in the 20th Battalion of Sepoys in 1787, 
when that battalion was in the 4th Brigade at Fatehgarh. He was at the 
battle of Bitaurah in 1794, his battalion being then in the Cawnpore 



52 

brigade. He saw active service iu the 2nd Mahratta War, Bundelkhand 
1803, Gwalior 1804, and again in Bundelkhand 1809. After leaving 
Fatehgarh in 1811-12 he was present at the siege of Hathras 1817, in 
which he commanded the 4th Infantry Brigade. From 1820 till his death 
he was commanding as Brigadier-General in Rohiikhand. 

The tomb of Mrs. Fliza Gamon in the Fort cemetery recalls the name 
of her father, Lieut.-Colonel Francis Rutledge (1760-1817), who followed 
Vanrenan. He sailed for India in 1778, and rose to the rank of Lieut.- 
Colonel of the 1/tfrd N. I. in 1805. He served through the operations 
in Bundelkhand 1809. Ills death occurred at Barrackpore, and his tomb 
is to lie seen in the cemetery at that place. A sale deed of the year 1813 
transliterates his name into Urdu as "Aylech"! 

At this epoch the Custom Records point to active progress in trade. 
The influx of traders and indigo planters was commencing, which rose to 
its height about 1835. The City had become an emporium of trade for 
the Upper Provinces, the Ganges forming a natural highway for fleets of 
boats transporting merchandise. John Deaneofthe Board of Commissioners 
paid a visit to Fatehgarh in 1809 in the course of his tour of inspection, 
and Mrs. Deane has loft some account, which unfortunately is very 
incomplete on the subject of Fatehgarh. She remarks that Farrukhabad 
was one of the best places for buying Kashmir shawls, and a fine cloth for 
neckcloths, called chandelly, which came from the Mahratta country. The 
Deanes appear to have stayed in Cantonments, and on their departure had 
a lucky escape. Their hosts had come out of the bungalow to see the 
DeaiKis off in their palanquins, when a flash of lightning struck the dining 
room. The house being a thatched one, caught on fire, and was burnt 
to the ground in a few hours. This accident is not mentioned in the 
records, but houses are stated to have been struck by lightning in 1807, 
and in 1812. In the latter year it was No. 20 Bungalow, which suffered in 
this manner. The Deanes sailed from Fatehgarh with six boats comprising 
one called a budgerow to sleep in, a pinnace to eat in, a boat fitted up 
as a kitchen, one for poultry, sheep and stores, one for servants and 
luggage, and a sixth for washing in. The description of the sixth boat 
is vague. The journey to Cawnpore took four days in September. The 



53 

first stage was Singhirampur, or with luck near to the junction of the 
Ramganga. Dai pur was the second stage, and Bithur the third. 

Lieut.-Colonei C. Crawford (1760-1836), had not long been Command- 
ing Officer, when he was appointed Surveyor-General. He retired in 1818, 
and died in Herefordshire. Lieut.-Colonei W. Bedell (1764-1829), later 
commanded the Dacca Provincial Battalion, and died at Dacca. Lieut- 
Colonel Bedell's command ceased at Fatehgarh on the outbreak of the 
Nepal War, when there was some considerable military activity in the 
Station. The Governor-General, the Marquis of Hastings, stayed more 
than five months in a house on the site of the present Engine Shed in the 
Railway Lines, in order to be near the scene of operations, and the Fort 
was put in repair. Amongst many regiments passing through to reach 
the Advanced Base at Sitapur was the 2/10 th N.I. under Lieut.-Colonei 
Voyle. On the day the regiment arrived at Sitapur it was ordered back 
to Fatehgarh. No sooner had it settled iu than orders crime to hurry to 
Sitapur again, and proceed on active service. When within a march of 
that place, Colonel Voyle was informed that peace had been declared, and 
his regiment was to return to Fatehgarh and be disbanded. 

The Gun Carriage Factory had started work in the Fort a year 
previously. In 1815 the Clothing Agency was in progress. The establish- 
ment of both these factories meant an increase of population to Cantonments; 
and they became an integral part of the history of Fatehgarh, lasting in 
the former case down to the end of the nineteenth century. 

During the 3rd Mahratta War there were no regular troops at 
Fatehgarh. The Dromedary Corps probably never was in the station, 
although for official purposes it was recorded so. It was raised in 1815, 
and disbanded in 1821. The Fatehgarh Levy made its appearance, and 
still exists as the 9th Gurkha Rifles. The Nassiri Battalions were also 
Gurkha Rifles. They are twice mentioned in memorial inscriptions in the 
Fort cemetery. The 2nd Recruit Depot Battalion, part of the garrison 
for the year 1839, was another odd formation, which requires some 
explanation. At the beginning of the 1st Afghan War two such battalions 
were formed by G. O. 8th September 1838 at Karnal and Meerut, each 
of which was to feed six regiments of Native Infantry on active service. 



54 

These two depots were transferred to Aligarh in 1839, and in the same 
year a second depot came into being at Fatehgarh under Major Earle. 

For the better supervision of the Nepal War, the Governor-General, 
who wasthen the Marquis of Hastings, fixed his headquarters at Fatehgarh 
during the hot weather of 1815, and the despatches relating to the war 
were written here. The Marquis kept a daily diary, which has since been 
published. In relating his many activities he has fortunately given more 
description of the Station than other contemporary visitors have troubled 
to do. He arrived on the 10th March with a numerous suite, the important 
members of which were the Military Secretary, the Persian Interpreter, 
eight aides-de-camp, three supernumerary ones, a doctor, and a chaplain. 
The last march was from Sakwaionthe Mainpuri Road, for the Governor- 
General came from Mainpuri, via Madanpur, and passing the area, where 
now stands the Central Jail, he crossed the old Rakha Cantonment and 
the Civil Lines in order to reach his camp, which was pitched on the 
parade ground by the present Victoria Memorial. The days were already 
too hot for living in tents, and the same evening a move was made to the 
Collector's house. Mr. Donnithorne, the Collector, had not long before 
built this residence on the space now occupied by the Engine Sheds 
of the B. H. &amp; C. I. Railway. For more than five months, up to the 
22nd August following, the Government of the country was directed from 
this spot. 

Many levees were held. Breakfasts werj given to distinguished 
visitors, like the young Nawab of Farrukhabad, and the Vizier of Oudh's 
sou. The 4th June was then the King's birthday, and celebrations had 
to be cancelled owing to the hot winds. In the evening, however, the 
troops tired a feu de joic on the parade ground. The Prince Regent's 
birthday fell on the 12th August. An entertainment was given to the 
residents of the Station. The garden was illuminated by fifty thousand 
lamps, and after a display of fireworks supper closed the day. The 
Marquis wrote in his diary that luckily the evening was cool. At daybreak 
on the 22nd August the Marquis sailed for Cawnpore down the Ganges. 
"Finally", he wrote, "we embarked in our boats, leaving with regret a 
number of individuals, from whom we have received the most unremittingly 



. PG 154/1 

a 

polite attentions." His regret was probably exceeded by the delight of 
the Collector in getting back into his own house after five months 1 dis- 
possession ! 

After the Marquis of Hastings no high dignitary visited the Station 
for over twelve years. In December 1827 the Commander-in Chief, Lord 
Combermere, arrived with his camp on a tour of inspection. Although 
Rakha Cavalry Cantonment had been abandoned for many years, it was 
still the locality chosen for camps of various troops, which made no 
lengthy stay. The 3rd Irregular Horse, known as Baddeley's Horse, was 
encamped on the race course, which can still roughly be traced at Rakha. 
Edward Picard, or Pacard, of Bush, Packard &amp; Co., an indigo manufac- 
turing concern at Mehndi Ghat, near Kananj, was probably a local 
Lieutenant in this corps in 1819. Picard had a close connection with 
Fatehgarh from 1830 onwards, and was also established at Bareilly. 

The 3rd Irregular Horse were reviewed on the parade ground. The 
regiment was dressed in Mussalman costume, and had a few British 
officers. The troopers gave an exhibition of tent-pegging. They fired 
their matchlocks in the air, the bullets whizzing over the heads of the 
spectators, and putting them to flight. A year later the corps was 
disbanded. After noting this review Lord Combermere's A.-D.-C. goes 
on to record some interesting details of the Station. He also says that 
Farrukhabad was famous for Kashmir shawls, and adds that puttoo cloth 
and precious stones were well-known commodities of the bazar. The 
neighbourhood was renowned for potatoes even at that early date. Land 
in the vicinity of the Cantonment bore excellent vegetables, and was let 
at Rs. 8 a bigha. Fatehgarh itself was very healthy, and the residents 
were loud in its praises. 

Lord Combermere's A.-D.-C. was a Major E. C. Archer, whose 
remarks on Fatehgarh will be found in his two-volume book called 
" Tours in Upper India," which appeared in 1833. His daughter is better 
remembered. She was the author of one of the very best accounts of life 
in India that has ever been printed. Mrs. Fanny Parks, to call her by 
her married name, was the wife of C C. Parks of the Bengal Civil 
Service (India 1817 to 1846). In 1832 Parks was Collector of Customs 



56 

at Allahabad. From that place his wife can-ied out her voyages on the 
Ganges and Jumna in a small yacht, visiting all places of interest, and 
including Kanauj and Fatehgarh on two occasions in 1835 and 1838, des- 
criptions of which fill the pages of her book " The Wanderings of a 
Pilgrim.*' Mrs. Parks was related to Mr. Swetenham, the Judge of 
Farrukhabad District from 1835 to 1841. Although she has little to say 
about the general appearance of Fatehgarh, there are in her book many 
interesting comments on local topics to which reference will be made in 
other chapters. 

The Hon'ble Emily Eden pissed through in 1838 with the Governor- 
General's camp. She is even more disappointing on the subject of 
Fatehgarh's appearance ; for she gives no topographical details at all in 
her letters, which were subsequently published in I860 under the title of 
" Up the Country." She was most impressed by the eccentric Civil 
Surgeon, Dr. Goss. She had weird ideas as to the geographical position 
of Fatehgarh, which she thought was thirty miles from Gwalior. She was 
amused by the uniform of an escort of Irregular Cavalry, which under the 
command of two British officers joined the camp. Officers and men wore 
green velvet tunics, red satin trousers, tucked into white leather boots ; 
while the faces of all were garnished with long beards. As they had no 
collars to their tunics, their bare necks and long beards gave them a comic 
appearance. 

Official records, however, show that by 1838 the Cantonment had 
Ixjen much improved. Roads like the Mall Road, and those leading to 
Be war and Gursahaiganj, were being metalled. Avenues of trees had 
been planted along the roads to the City and Ghatia Ghat. Hakim 
Mehdi Ali's house (the Indian Military Hospital), the Theatre, the 
Church, the present residence of the Collector, Martin's house on the river 
bank, and that containing the District Courts, where now the Railway 
Engine Shed stands, were all substantial buildings, giving an air of 
permanency to the Station. With one or two exceptions the houses of 
the residents, however, remained thatched bungalows with mud walls, 
small in size, and insignificant in extent. A few scattered allusions in the 
records seem to indicate that the occupiers kept up flower gardens around 



57 

their houses, and compound walls were carefully maintained. By 1835 
it may be said that Fatehgarh had taken on its present appearance, and 
this year has been taken as a convenient one for compiling a sketch map 
of the Station, which will be found at the end of this memoir. Much in- 
formation has been obtained from the lists compiled for the settlement of 
Land Revenue in 1833. The Registrar's office, too, is rich in deeds of 
sale and mortgage of houses at this period; whilst lastly an excellent 
history of the Farrukhabad District appeared in 1846, which although it 
gives far too few details about Fatehgarh itself, has appended at the end 
a rough sketch map of the Cantonment and Civil Lines. This account is 
called the " Fatehgarh-nama of Babu Kale Rai," and copies are still to 
be found in the possession of old families of the District. Another local 
history in Urdu was written by Mufti Wali Ullah in 1830 ; but unfortu- 
nately it contains no topographical description of Fatehgarh, and scarcely 
mentions the place at all. The memoir of the Bangash Nawabs of 
Farrukhabad, compiled by C. W. Irvine, I. C. S., a Joint Magistrate and 
officiating Collector of the District, and published in the Journal of the 
Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1878, has nothing to tell about Fatehgarh. 
The most valuable contemporary document is undoubtedly the diary of 
Nawab Doolah, the husband of the celebrated Nawab Jaffri Begum of 
Shamsabad. Nawab Doolah wrote a copious daily account of his life in 
Persian, which incidentally recounts his visits to Fatehgarh, and the calls 
which he paid on the various officers of the Station between 1830 and 
1852. Most unfortunately only one volume has survived. It is at 
present preserved by Nawab Ladle Sahib at Shamsabad. 

The disturbances over the mutiny of the Baiza Bai's troops at 
Barhpur broke the quiet of 1835. An account of them has been given 
in a separate chapter. With this exception, however, nothing occurred 
at Fatehgarh to interfere with the daily routine down to the Mutiny of 
1857. The Cantonment and Civil Station, inhabited now largely by 
Europeans and Eurasians, who were permanently domiciled in the place, 
were monotonously calm. Fatehgarh speedily became a backwater, 
yielding place in importance to surrounding districts. Babu Kale Rai 
narrates a few outstanding events, which struck him as peculiarly impor- 



58 

tant, and so were chronicled in the Fatehgarh-nania. In 1840, he says, 
the earth opened in Pargana Araritpur. A light issued, and a statue of 
Shiv appeared, which was worshipped by the cultivators. In 1841 the 
Nawab's fort in Farrukhabad was struck by lightning. The nett year a 
great fire broke out in the City, which caused damage to the amount of 
two lakhs of rupees. On the 21st March 1843 an unprecedented incident 
took place at Goshain, a hamlet of Pachaur in Pargana Tirwa. Lumps of 
meat, containing no bones, and each about two maunds in weight, rained 
down from the sky upon the fortunate inhabitants I On the 13th to 16th 
June 1846 a battery of artillery came down the new Grand Trunk Road 
from Lahore, an event which apparently was regarded as being no less 
supernatural. Despite the prohibition of the custom of performing suttee, 
the practice lingered on in Fatehgarh after 1829, the year when these 
rites were made illegal. In 1832 a widow was burnt to death in front of 
an immense crowd of 10,000 persons. The manager of the ceremony was 
sentenced to imprisonment for two years. Seven years later another big 
suttee was performed near Cantonments. This time two pei'sons were 
arrested, and received five years' imprisonment each. 

The palmy days of Fatehgarh as a Sudder Station were undoubtedly 
about 1835, just before the great famine, which two years later swept 
over the country, and brought great misery in its train. Perhaps the 
event which more than any other changed the face of the Station, 
sharply dividing the old Fatehgarh from the new, was the metalling of 
the Trunk Road. This is the road to Rohilkhand, which passing 
through Fatehgarh Town bazar, sweeps round the parade ground, and 
stops at the Ganges by the Ghatia Ghat ferry. It joins the Grand Trunk 
Road at Gursahaiganj, and is often wrongly called by the same name. At all 
periods this road has been the main Cantonment thoroughfare. The fine 
nim trees, which stand upon the edge of the parade ground on the 
western side, indicate the exact site of one side of the old Infantry Lines. 
The infantry corps of the Temporary Brigade were packed into thatched 
barracks of mud, which ran in short parallel lines, each line end on to 
the road, and on both sides of it, throughout the length of the parade 
ground up to the Sudder Bazar, which in the eighteenth century was of 



50 

modest dimensions. It was undoubtedly to this road that Lord Valentia 
referred in the account of his visit to Fatehgarh in 1808. He had come 
from Cawnpore, and was met near Bhojpur by a "sociable," a clumsy 
kind of four-wheeled carriage with seats facing, which was to conduct 
him to his destination with some show of state. Preceded by a cavalry 
escort in front, and one behind, Lord Valentia drove in the sociable along 
the Lines, each guard turning out, and presenting arms. The house of 
Mr. Grant, the Magistrate, in whose compound the visitor's tents were to 
be pitched, has not been traced, but it was at the northern end of the 
station, somewhere in the Park. 

A great transformation of the Station had taken place by 1855. 
Residents of the early part of the nineteenth century would have been 
less familiar with the place than those of to-day. This was due to the 
metalling of the roads, and to the disappearance of many compounds, 
which had long been empty for want of occupants. The making 
of roads, bridges, and drains; the demolition of compound walls; 
the planting of trees and cleaning up of the side walks were due to 
convict labour, supervised by the Magistrate and the Road Committee 
The most senior officers in the Station were elected to this committee. In 
1842 R. H. S. Campbell, the Collector, presided over it. The members 
were R.B. Thornhill (officiating Judge), Major T. Lumsden, C.B. (Agent, 
Gun Carriage Factory), Major J.H. Simmonds (Agent, Clothing Factory) 
Doctor T. C. Hunter (Civil Surgeon), J. Mercer (Registrar), W. H. 
DeGruyther (Deputy Collector), Pandit Daya Ram, and Munshi Benarsi 
Das. The labours of these Road Committees are fully recorded in the 
papers belonging to the years 1835 to 1855, and all the roads of to-day 
were constructed in that period. The road from Fatehgarh to the Kali 
Nadi at Khudaganj was made in 1847. It crossed that stream by the 
suspension bridge, which Nawab Hakim Mehdi Ali Khan had constructed 
ten years previously, in order to join the metalled road from Gursahai- 
ganj. The latter portion of the road had been commenced seven years 
earlier. William Hine had come to grief over his accounts in connection 
with its construction in 1842. The road from Bholepur to Nekpur was 
metalled in 1853, and as a matter of fact only one road had been left in 



60 

its old state by the time of the outbreak of the Mutiny. This road, 
curiously enough, has never been touched. It is the old Jail Road, which runs 
from Bholepur to the Commissariat Godown. A good picture of the roads 
is given in a letter by Mr. Shore, the Magistrate in 1888. He writes to 
the Commissioner : " The plan hitherto adopted of repairing the roads, 
was merely to scrape and smooth them after they were cut up by rain; 
this had gone on so long that there was really nothing left to scrape; the 
roads being in some places five feet below the adjoining ground ; and at 
the beginning of the late rainy season (1832) many parts were naturally 
impassible. It was obvious that unless some general plan of raising and 
widening the roads were adopted they must remain as they were; but 
there was no place in the Station whence earth could be dug to raise 
them." With the help of Captain Fulton (Agent, Clothing Factory) 
Shore induced the residents to give earth from their compounds. He was 
able after great exertions to raise the roads to their present level. 
This desperate expedient failed on the Trunk Road. In 1836 
Mr. Rose (Joint Magistrate) wrote a report on it, in which he described 
the road as a soft unmetalled one, filled with ruts and holes, and ankle 
deep in dust, or in the rains with mud and water. The road had fallen 
into such a state of disrepair as to be impassible. The residents, there- 
fore, opened a subscription fund for procuring kankar. Captain Lumsden, 
the Gun Carriage Agent, undertook the management. The Commissioner, 
Mr. Boulderson, sent him a hundred convicts, and the road was for the 
first time properly metalled. 

After this date the appearance of the road changed. Already many 
years before, the " Line Telingan " as the barracks were called by an old 
Madras expression, had dwindled down to ten rows of huts in two 
blocks of five rows each, opposite No. 19 Bungalow. For thirty years 
there had not been more than one regiment in garrison. The animated 
scenes of the eighteenth century, when the troops of the old brigade 
thronged the Lines down to the Sadder Bazar, had passed from memory. 
In 1857 the men of the 10th N. I . , " Duffel ki paltan," would have been 
seen here in red coats with dark-green facings. In front of their lines, 
where now is the Cantonment Office, took place the tumultuous scenes of 



61 

the 4th of June parade, when Colonel Smith narrowly escaped with his 
life ; and here too the 10th met the 41st " Doobye ki paltan " from Sita- 
pur, and exchanged shots to decide who should own the district treasure. 

The Lines have disappeared. The Cantonment office, which seems 
later on to have been quarters for a medical officer, and the Memorial 
Church have made their appearance ; but with these exceptions the parade 
ground has remained unchanged. The Diggi Tank in the centre was made 
in 1827 by Mr. Middleton, the Judge, at a total cost of Rs. 3,100 of which 
Government gave Rs. 1,500. Mr. Middleton gave Rs. QOOoutof hj s own 
pocket, and the rest was raised locally. After a few years the tank deterio- 
rated, and it was continually being repaired by convict gangs. It is now 
used as a wrestling arena by the men of the 10/7th Rajput Regiment. 

In pre-Mutiny days there was no Station Club. There was an 
Officers' Mess it is true; but there was no meeting place for ladies, who 
apparently did no calling on each other. The Theatre had declined long 
before 1840. The records of the thirties are so silent about its existence, 
as to lead to the inference that the Theatre was no longer the assembly 
place of the Station. Consequently, the only rendezvous was the Diggi 
Tank. Here on Tuesday and Friday evenings played the band, affording 
some distraction to the residents sitting in their carriages. Close by the 
tank are the foundations of a small building, the use of which is not 
exactly known. Bazar tradition says it was the regimental armoury of 
the pre-Mutiny garrison. 

That portion of the parade ground immediately in front of the old 
Church was and still is the official camping ground. Several large camps 
have been laid out on this spot, and that of the Marquis of Hastings in 
1815 was the first. In 1887, and a year later in December 18#8,. the 
Commander-in-Chief, Lord Combermere, camped here with fifty double 
pole tents, and a following of five thousand persons, including one 
squadron, and the band of the 11th Light Dragoons. Captain Mundy, his 
A.-D.-C, says that each officer on the headquarter staff had a double 
pole tent, one rowtee, one servants' pal, two elephants, six camels, four 
horses, one pony, a buggy, and 24 servants besides mahouts, camel drivers 
etc. Ten years after, however, an infinitely bigger camp was pitched 



62 

for Lord Auckland, which had to overflow into the fields behind Colonel- 
ganj. His sister, the Hon. Emily Eden, writes that they stayed in 
Fatehgarh from January 10th to 15th, and then marched across the 
river to Amritpur. Lord Auckland was accompanied in his tour by 
eleven thousand persons, hundreds of elephant*, camels and equipages 
of all kinds. The monthly cost of this horde to Government was seventy 
thousand rupees; while three or four hundred rupees compensation had 
to be paid daily to the cultivators for damage done to their fields. Mrs. 
Fanny Parks vainly attempted to accompany this small army on its 
march, and her tribulations are described in her book. She deserted at 
Amritpur, when an officious aide-de-camp ordered her off for inadvertently 
pitching her tents on a spot sacred to the Governor-General. 

On December 26, 1851, arrived Lord Dalhousie with a smaller 
retinue. One of his objects was to call on Maharaja Dhuleep Singh. Sir 
William Gomm, the Commander-iti Chief, followed in February 1854. 
During his stay the Adjutant-General, Colonel Mountain, died and was 
buried in the Fort. 

The Column under Sir Colin Campbell, which appeared in 1858, 
after destroying the " Doobye ki paltan " at the Kali Nadi battle, camped 
on the parade ground, in the numerous groves behind Kasim Bagh, and 
in the vicinity of Naugaon, and the Fort. The following year a camp 
was laid out here for the Durbar of Lord Canning. It is interesting to 
know that the future Field-Marshal Lord Roberts was the Staff Officer 
who made the arrangements. 

For several years, at the end of the Trunk road just where the 
Bazar commences, there were huts in which a guard was placed in con- 
sequence of a famous riot in 1834. The 1st N. I, was then in Fatehgarh 
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Tapp. It appears that several sepoys 
were beaten by the townsmen in a street fight. The sepoys returned 
with large reinforcements, and started a battle royal, in which seventeen 
persons were stretched on the ground. The Town was placed out of 
bounds. At a cost of Rs. 15, huts were erected to contain a guard. 
This was extremely irksome to the sepoys, who lived so close to the bazar, 
and every month riots were anticipated. 



68 

The only building devoted to civil uses en the parade ground side 
of the Trunk Road was the dak bungalow, which stood upon the site of 
the present Post Office. For several years prior to the Mutiny it had not 
been used for the reception of visitors. The records are silent as to 
where such accommodation was provided. For several nights before the 
outbreak of the Mutiny on the 18th June 1857, the Officers of the 10th 
N. I. slept together in the house, since it stood at the end of the Lines, 
and close touch with the sepoys could be maintained. Curiously enough, 
it was actually used as a post office; and the arrangements are of interest. 
The building was hired for Rs. 10 monthly. There was a staff of twenty- 
one postmen and eleven bahnngidars. The latter carried parcels slung 
from each end of a bamboo balanced on the shoulder. The dak is still 
carried to officers in camp in this fashion. The monthly expenditure was 
Rs. 326. 

The first Postmasters were the Collectors of the District. For a staff 
they were allowed one clerk and a sorter. A number of runners on Rs. 3 
monthly wages carried the letters in leather bags to Cawnpore, each man 
covering a stage of 8 or 10 miles, and bringing back the post from the 
other direction. In 1840, the Commissioner allowed Rs. 25 for a set of 
new leather bags. 

Arrangements for conveyance of the mails in the eighteenth century 
were as complete as could be expected. A mail service was set on foot 
in October 1778, as soon as the Temporary Brigade was established in its 
camp. Mails were conveyed from Benares to Daranagar beyond Morada- 
bad, where there was a detachment of troops. Cawnpore to Fatehgarh 
was the stage, which most concerned the Temporary Brigade. A staff of 
24 runners, 8 torn torn drummers, and 8 torch bearers was allowed. The 
duty of the drummers was to frighten wild beasts, and keep them from 
attacking the runners. The runners were paid Rs. 7 per mensem, and the 
others Rs. 3. In 1799, Lieutenant A. Orme was Deputy Postmaster. He 
complained to the Postmaster-General that the number of runners was in- 
sufficient, the mail having become very heavy. 

Up to 1820 or thereabouts, this postal service seems only to have 
been for official use. Private postal services nevertheless existed in 



04 

numbers until prohibited by the Act of 1837. The custom of using the 
official post for private correspondence led to the sending of valuables by 
this medium ; and in .1808, the mail between Fatehgarh and Cawnpore 
was robbed regularly every week. A Government Order, issued in 1809, 
forbade the sending of valuables. It discloses that residents had been 
accustomed to send jewellery, and even watches, through the post. 

Up to 1846 from a time unknown, the Civil Surgeon was Postmaster 
at Fatehgarh. After that year, Mr. Dunbar was this official. The Mutiny 
lists show Mr. Kew as Postmaster, and Mr. Catania as Inspector of Post 
Offices. Whole-time supervision had long been necessary. Complaints 
were rife as to the morals of the postal staff. In 1834 the Civil Surgeon 
despairingly reported to the Commissioner that the whole of his establish- 
ment was embezzling money. 

The postal runners gave way to horses, then came ekkas, and lastly 
postal waggons. The waggons were always being robbed, and in 1854 
the Magistrate reported a big loss. At all times the post was uncertain. 
Waggons being more reliable were an advance on the runners, who hardly 
ever ran, and consumed time at the end of their stages. In 1813, it was 
reported that the post left Cawnpore at 10 p. m. at night, and reached 
Fatehgarh 26 hours later in the middle of the second night, when the 
runners were conscientious; otherwise no one could say when the post 
would come. 

A curious notice was published in 1859 by the P. M. G. He notified 
Lieutenant Swetenham of the 10th N. I. that three boxes of six barrels for 
an organ, addressed to him, would be sold by auction if not claimed in three 
months. This unfortunate officer, however, had two years previously 
been murdered at Cawnpore by the Nana. 

The Trunk Road continued on into the Sudder Bazar, which arose 
into being to meet the requirements of the Temporary Brigade, and prior 
to 1803 it was small. The introduction of the District Courts, the Board 
of Revenue, and the Mint transformed the old brigade bazar into a 
considerable town. Life also in Farrukhabad City -was insecure. The 
first British officials forced their subordinates to build houses in Fatehgarh, 
which soon acquired a large population. In 1803 Lord Valentia writes 



65 

that murders had been so frequent in Farrukhabad the year before, that 
people did not dare to venture there after sunset. The workmen, who 
came out to Cantonments, always returned during daylight. The sudden 
irruption of Holkar in 1804 emptied Fatehgarh Town, the inhabitants 
flying to the City, and shutting the gates. The Judge, Mr. Potts, remarked 
that on that occasion not one even of his orderlies remained on duty. 
From that date until the Mutiny fifty-three years later, the Town 
increased at a normal pace. Beyond the Kotwali and a small hospital, 
opposite the present Municipal Office, it had no public buildings, and its 
history was uneventful. 

Within a stone's throw of the present Civil Hospital, and adjoining 
the Town, was the Theatre. Amateur theatricals were one of the most 
popular amusements of old military stations. First mention of the Fateh- 
garh house will be found in Lieutenant Poster's diary of " War and Sport 
in India" under date the 25th May 1803. "About ten we left Wemyss's 
(James Wemyss, Assistant Magistrate with whom he was staying) to go 
to see a play performed by gentlemen, and arrived just in time for Act 
the second of " She Stoops to Conquer ". It seemed to afford the old 
ladies great amusement, and many of the ladies assembled on this occasion, 
although from England, I think very probably had never seen a play 
before. Went home at 1 a. m." 

The Marquis of Hastings several times mentions the Theatre in his 
diary. On his arrival in March 1815 his camp was pitched close to it, 
and indeed the southern portion of the parade ground is still the camping 
ground. His remarks, too, indicate the size of the building, since in 1815 
no church existing at Fatehgarh, divine service was held for all the resi- 
dents of Cantonments in a large room in the theatre building. The 
residents at that date together with the Governor-General's suite could 
not have numbered less than a hundred. The actual position of the 
Theatre has only been discovered with difficulty, so thoroughly have its 
traces disappeared. The foundations are not visible, and no mark is to be 
seen on the ground. A clue was found in the records, and fortunately 
could be verified on the spot. A list of works of public utility, drawn up 
by Mr. Swetenham some time in the thirties, gives the name of one Sobha 



66 

Ram, a chaprassi of the Army Clothing Factory, as having planted a 
tamarind and a goolar tree close to the Theatre. Both these trees are 
still standing, and mark the site indicated by the 1846 map as an empty 
compound. It is that space, south of the Victoria Memorial, which extends 
from the City Road up to the walls of the Civil Hospital. On this spot, 
therefore, took place the chief gatherings of the society of old Fatehgarh 
in the pursuit of amusement. In days when there were no outdoor games 
or clubs, the Theatre, or Assembly Rooms, were the chief rendezvous in 
the Station. Here took place dances and suppers, as well as private 
theatricals. There were several musicians in Fatehgarh, whose services 
were sufficiently in request for dances as to enable them to earn a living. 
In 1802, and for many years onwards, Christian Lundt practised this 
profession. From 1829 to 1836 C. Braggs followed him. 



CHAPTER III. 

THE FORT. 



THE first work of Nawab Mohamed Khan, the founder of Furrftv aa- 
bad, was the building of the walls of the City in 1714. By 
1720 he had also erected the Fort on the Ganges 1 bank to cover the 
crossing of the river. He built it of mud with ten bastions and a moat. 
In this form it has remained substantially up to the present day. It has 
a circumference of 1,500 yards, and the moat appears always to have 
been dry. 

Before the arrival of the Temporary Brigade, the Fort had sustained 
the first of its three sieges, and received its name. In 1751 Nawab 
Ahmad, being attacked by the combined forces of Oudh, the Mahrattas, 
and the Jats, threw up an entrenched camp around the three land sides, 
and beat off all assaults. In his elation he named the Fort "Fatehgarh", 
or Fort Victory. In doing so he displayed unconscious irony ; for he was 
very soon afterwards soundly beaten, driven out of the Fort, and com- 
pelled to fly across the Ganges. Thus, the name "Fatehgarh" belongs 
only to the Fort. There is no village of that name. The Cantonments 
and Civil Station, spreading through the three villages of Bholepur, 
Bhakramau, and Husainpur, and being themselves military in origin, 
naturally adopted the name. 

In 1777 when the Temporary Brigade concentrated in the vicinity, 
the Fort was found to be the property of the Nawab Vizier of Oudh, who 
was suzerain of the local Nawabs and of all territory around, from the 
Ganges to the Jumna. The Nawab had no use for the Fort, and it was 
empty. It was also in very ruinous condition. An officer having built 
a bungalow alongside, arranged to use the Fort as his servants' quartern! 
Complaint was made by the Oudh authorities. The Officer Commanding 
then took over the place, and converting the Fort to proper uses, made 
it the magazine of the Temporary Brigade. The interior at this date 
only contained mud buildings and sheds of no extent. In 1778 the 



68 

brigade artillery found ample room there for their lines, within which 
could be housed their guns and personnel. Three companies of artillery, 
the 6th, 7th, and 8th, together with the Nawab Vizier's " battering 
artillery " went into these new quarters under their first commandant, 
Major Patrick Duff. Up to the end of the century the Fort was called 
the " Magazine". At sunrise and sunset each day a signal gun was 
fired. Here too was the ferry over the river, which stopped working 
after the evening gun at 9 p. m. ... 

In 1797 Deputy Commissary Catts and two conductors of ordnance 
were present. Catts was still in Fatehgarh seven years later. He had 
done very good work in preparing for the 2nd Mahratta War. He 
supplied Lord Lake's Grand Army with military stores from the Fort, 
which had been turned into an immense depot of munitions and guns for 
the campaign. He was highly commended by Lord Lake, and on the 1st 
September 1803 was promoted by Government to the rank of Commissary 
of ordnance as a special case ; for the Magazine at Fatehgarh was always 
in charge of a Deputy commissary. 

Captain A. M. Mathews followed Catts. Although Fatehgarh after 
1805 ceased to be the headquarters of a brigade, the Magazine was still 
important. Captain Mathews was also a commissary in rank, and three 
conductors of ordnance assisted him. Not only the Magazine in the Fort, 
but the District also supplied the army with weapons and stores ; and 
Captain Mathews did much to stimulate local factories. In 1806 tulwars, 
made at Shamsabad, had a great name throughout Bengal. The records show 
that a tulwar made at Shamsabad cost Rs. 7/4,. and similar weapons from 
Farrukhabad could be supplied through Captain Mathews for Rs. 5/8 each. 

From 1790 onwards the Fort was devoted to the purposes of a 
magazine only, the artillery corps having formed permanent lines of its 
own outside. Annual survey reports indicate the existence of four pow- 
der rooms, dry store rooms, and a " bankshall ", or store house of some 
special description. A hut was built for the Magazine Sergeant in 1795, 
and the next year a guard room was erected. 

The Fort was at no time armed for defence. When Jaswant Rao 
Holkar and his Mahratta force made their raid on Farrukhabad in 



69 

November 1804, there were no guns of any description in it. Not only 
was the Fort defenceless, but the Infantry Cantonment and that of the 
Cavalry at Rakha were equally at the mercy of the raiders ; for a year 
previously the Fatehgarh Brigade under Major-General Charles Ware had 
left the Station in order to join Lord Lake's army at Gursahaiganj for the 
Delhi campaign. It is possible to draw information about this invasion 
from two sources, both of which are easily available for residents of 
Fatehgarh. The story of Lord Lake's operations, and his surprise of the 
Mahrattas at Farrukhabad, is related by Captain Thorn in his "History of 
the Late War," a rare book which is in the Club library. The movements 
of the Mahrattas in the vicinity of Farrukhabad are depicted in a most 
picturesque manner by Mir Bahadur AM, who had himself lived a life, 
crowded with sufficient incident to fill a volume ; for he had gained his 
livelihood by practising professions as varied as those of trooper in the 
King of Oudh's cavalry, tutor to the Raja of Tirwa's children, court 
official in the Collectorate, and poet in the City. In his old age (1840) 
he edited and added to the " Lauh-i-Tarikh," a history of the Bangash 
Nawabs ; and it is while describing the life and times of Nawab Nasir-i- 
Jang that incidentally he gives the story of Holk&amp;r with a wealth of detail 
and an accuracy, which indicates him to have been a close spectator of 
the raid of 1804. 

Holkar set out from Indore with sixty thousand horsemen with the 
intention of scouring the western districts of Bengal; and if there was 
nothing to bar the way to the east, he had every expectation of reaching 
Calcutta, and exterminating the Feringhis. This plan of campaign, how- 
ever, was wrecked at a spot exactly three miles from Fatehgarh. By the 
second week of November 1804 the raiders arrived at Aliganj in the 
modern district of Ftah. This town was at that time held for the Bangash 
Nawab by a tahsildar, who after satisfying the dictates of honour by shut- 
ting the gates of his fort, and hurling defiance at the invaders, fled 
stealthily in the middle of the night to his master at Farrukhabad. There 
was nothing in front of Holkar to spoil the pleasurable expectation of 
looting Farrukhabad City, and leaving in his rear General Pollock, who 
was vainly trying to collect the Company's troops at Kasganj, he marched 



70 

unopposed to Nawabganj, only sixteen miles from the City. Here he 
halted on the 14th November, while his horsemen looted the surrounding 
country. This day Khairati Khan Bangash with eleven followers visited 
him with a conciliatory message from the Nawab of Farrukhabad, who, 
like the inhabitants of Cantonments, was in no condition to resist. It was 
therefore plainly necessary for him to temporise. 

Meanwhile the alarming news of Holkar's arrival at Nawabganj had 
reached the authorities. The residents of the Station took refuge in the 
Fort. The inhabitants of Fatehgarh Town fled into the City, the gates of 
which were shut. With the exception of one company of the 10th Native 
Infantry in the Lines, there was not a soul between Fatehgarh Fort and 
the City, when early in the morning on the 15th Holkar set out from 
Nawabganj with the Bangash envoy in his suite. He was riding his 
favourite pony, called " Natwi," which pranced like a peacock, and was 
worth fifty thousand rupees ! On the way a second delegation from the 
Nawab was met. Sarmat Khan, one of the Nawab's personal companions, 
riding on an elephant, and attended by fifty horsemen, advanced to wel- 
come the Mahratta. Khairati Khan, constituting himself master of the 
ceremonies, advised Holkar to embrace Sarmat Khan in the familiar 
Bangash style. The annalist does not record how this was carried out, 
but presumably both parties descended to earth with as much dignity as 
possible, for Holkar is recorded to have hugged the friend of the Nawab 
in his arms, and to have. proceeded amicably on his way, discussing the 
curious customs of the Bangashes. In no little time the column reached 
the City, and halted before the Mau Gate. It is possible now to stand 
upon the very spot, whera Holkar sat down for a rest, until the City Gate 
should be opened to receive him. A bare hundred yards from the Mau 
Gate, by the western side of the Kaimganj Road, there is still to be seen 
a very old baoli, surmounted by two small turrets, which was part of the 
system of irrigation in the famous Hayat Bagh. This baoli, indeed, is all 
that remains to tell of the splendours of the garden, which surrounded 
the mausoleum of Nawab Mohamed Khan, upon which was annually spent 
the income of twelve villages. When Holkar sat down by the well, the 
tomb and garden were already in a state of ruin, although far from being 



71 

the melancholy spectacle of to-day. The baoli and well, however, are yet 
to be seen in a state of fine preservation. 

Holkar ordered the City Gate to be opened. A little by-play then 
ensued, which Mir Bahadur Ali lovingly records in great detail. Mirza 
Hatta Beg, Jemadar, was on guard with the custodians of the gate. " I 
will open the gate," he sent word, " when Nawab Nasir-i-Jang gives me 
permission to do so." Holkar was unchivalrous enough to contemplate 
breaking the gate open, when Khaireti Khan adroitly suggested that it 
would be rash to enter the City in person : " for," he said, " the houses 
of this City are very lofty, and who knows but some Feringhi might fire 
a shot from an upper storey?" Holkar decided to skirt the City, after 
hearing this wise counsel, and followed by his horsemen proceeded to the 
Jasmai Gate, between which and Dhilawal village was a plain eminently 
suitable for his camp. On this spot, therefore, the tents, munition carts, 
and camp equipage were arranged. The East Indian Railway now passes 
over it before reaching Farrukhabad City Railway Station. 

A horde of attendants, which swelled the numbers of the invader's 
army to over one hundred thousand persons, settled down upon the plain ; 
and swarms of Mahratta horsemen spread out in every direction around 
the City to loot and destroy. The Sudder Bazar (Fatehgarh Town) was 
ravaged. The Cavalry Lines and bungalows at Rakha, the ice house 
close-by, were set on fire. The guards at the Jail (then at Qadri Gate) 
left their posts, and the prisoners escaped. For their re-capture after- 
wards it was necessary to offer a reward of Rs. 25 per head. The 
Treasury which stood on the ground of the modern Engine Shed, was also 
left deserted. Sewak Ram, the Kotwal of the City, hastily abandoned 
the Kotwali in Katra Ahmadganj, and betook himself to the other side 
of the Ganges. Nine hundred chaprasis took off their badges, and hid 
them. When questioned by the Mahrattas they claimed to be soldiers of 
the Nawab's service. The Infantry Cantonment does not seem to have 
been badly treated. The company of the 10th Native Infantry were 
drawn up in line on the parade ground, facing the Mahrattas in sublime 
ignorance of their danger. Their sole officer was an ensign of four years' 
service', who was afterwards Lieutenant-General Sir John Hunter Littler, 



72 

G. C. B., a divisional commander in the Sikh Wars, and in 1858 a 
member of the Governor-General's Council. He was eventually induced 
to enter the Fort. After his withdrawal the place was promptly invested 
by marauding Pathans and Mahrattas. 

There are no details available about this siege, if siege it can be 
called. There was no fighting, and the Mahrattas were only in possession 
of Fatehgarh for two days. This was a fortunate circumstance for the 
defenders, who had been forced to rush into the Fort with their families 
at the shortest notice. So destitute were they of all means of defence that 
Mr. W. P. Potts, the acting Judge and Magistrate (died at Fatehgarh 
October 1806), rode down to the Nawab's palace in the City to borrow 
a cannon at the moment when Holkar was settling into his quarters by 
Dhilawal village. Mr. Potts went alone through the City on his errand. 
It would be interesting to know if this was an act of rashness on his part, 
or simply because no one else in the Fort had the courage to accompany 
him. He asked the Nawab for a long-range gun. The Nawab refused, 
either to lend a gun, or give any assistance. He asserted that his two 
twelve-pounders and the eighteen-pounder had been broken up. Mr, 
Potts is described by Mir Bahadur Ali as riding quietly through the 
long bazar from the Nawab's Fort to Tirpolia, with a loaded pistol in 
each hand. After getting through the narrow gateway, which still spans 
the Tripolia bazar, he set spurs to his horse, and galloping to the Qadri 
Gate, passed rapidly down the road to Kasim Bagh and the Fort, The 
Mahrattas perceived him, and gave chase. They threw spears at him, 
and, indeed, he was forced to ride for his life up to the very gates of the 
Fort. So realistic is the narrative of the Lauh-i-Tarikh, that Mir Bahadur 
Ali may well have seen Mr. Potts' flight with his own eyes. He remarks 
that Mr. Potts was afterwards very bitter towards the Nawab, and did 
his best to inflame Lord Lake against him. 

Nawab Nasir-i-Jang was now to undergo trials of his own. During 
the afternoon of the 15th, Holkar summoned him to the Mahratta camp. 
The Nawab had come out of the Khas Mahal (site of the present 
Municipal Town Hall), and with his elephants and attendants awaiting 
him, was about to start for the Jasmai Gate, when troops, attendants and 



73 

all, surrounded him with loud demands for their arrears of pay. The 
Nawab put them off in vain. Dalpat Rai, his chief minister, had just 
that minute climbed into the howdah of his kneeling elephant. The irate 
soldiers struck at him with their tulwars, and only the sides of the 
howdah saved him from being cut to pieces. The Nawab sent his gold 
huqqatothe bazar to be pawned, and thus procuring money to pay them, 
kept the mutinous soldiery from venting their rage on the unpopular 
minister. The Nawab was literally without funds at all, for he received 
his stipend monthly from the Fatehgarh Treasury, and had not been paid 
a rupee for six months. This fact had not for one moment influenced the 
troops. They pertinently remarked that arrears of pay were only useful 
for the living, and that as many of them would probably lose their lives 
at Dhilawal that day, they preferred not to wait. 

With due ceremony the Nawab was received by Holkar sitting on 
his gaddl. Mir Bahadur Ali attempts to reproduce the conversation 
which followed. The Nawab enquired for news of General Pollock. 
Holkar grinned, replying that he thought General Pollock was busy at 
Kasganj. He wasted no further time, and before the Nawab could 
continue his flow of compliments and the enquiries which etiquette 
demanded, brusquely asked for five lakhs of rupees as ransom for the 
City. The Nawab and his followers were full of consternation. The 
tension became so great that an outbreak by one or the other party seemed 
imminent. Pateh Mir Khan, an Afridi of Mau (Kaimganj), in order to 
protect the Nawab, moved behind Holkar, being prepared to cut him 
down at the first sign of treachery. Holkar noticed this, and Fateh Mir 
Khan must have been an imposing figure. The historian describes him 
as clothed in chain mail, wearing iron gauntlets, and armed to the teeth. 
He was noted for reckless daring, and had once slain a tiger with a 
sword cut. He was still living in 1840, and doubtless supplied Mir 
Bahadur Ali with many details. Holkar, whether daunted by this 
apparition or not, brought the proceedings to a close, remarking that 
for days past he had not had time even for a smoke. The Nawab, 
leaving Dalpat Rai to continue the necessary haggling over the ransom 
for the City, departed home, and no doubt remembering Holkar's pressing 



74 

need for a smoke, sent him a silvev huqqa and a gurguri (small portable 
huqqa, used when travelling in a palanquin). A flower vase, pan box, 
and scent bottle, all of silver, completed this peace offering. 

The next day, the 16th November, Holkar again sent for the Nawab, 
who fearing a trap, excused himself by alleging the pressing necessities 
of religious devotion, and promised to come on the morrow. Holkar is 
said to have passed the day and the night that followed in much less 
edifying fashion. The Mahratta army, in fact, appears to have drunk 
too deeply to keep a good look-out. It was a complete surprise for them, 
when at daybreak the 8th Royal Irish Dragoons dashed into the camp, 
assisted by discharges of grape shot from the horse artillery battery of 
Major Clements Brown, an officer whose after career was connected with 
Fatehgarh, and the Fort in particular. The Mahratta ammunition train 
caught fire. An explosion heralded the destruction of each cart, as the 
fire ran from one to the other. This explains in large measure the heavy 
losses of the Mahrattas, and the total destruction of their camp. Holkar 
himself escaped to Mainpuri, and closely pursued, had to push on towards 
Lahore without being able to regain his own country. The total sum 
of his losses was not known, but SOO wounded Mahrattas were taken to 
hospital. Mir Bahadur AM says that General Pollock created great 
havoc in the camp. The neighbouring villagers, hovering around, wiped 
out thousands of the fugitives for many days after. Sarmat Khan, the 
Nawab's representative, was caught escaping on his elephant, and was 
pistolled by the troopers. Khairati Khan managed to get clear of the 
rout. A price of Rs. 1,000, however, was placed on his head, his house 
in the City being confiscated and sold. After the signing of peace 
by Holkar, he was pardoned by the Government, and returned to 
Farrukhabad. 

Mir Bahadur AM, in conclusion of his story, has a long account of 
Lord Lake's proceedings with the Nawab, for which there are no grounds. 
He says that Lord Lake gave orders for the arrest of the Nawab and the 
punishment of the City. The artillery, facing the City, was drawn up 
on the parade ground, but not with the sinister intentions, which Mir 
Bahadur AM attributed to it. As will be seen later, preparations were 



75 

merely being made to fire a salute! Lord Lake's losses were two 
dragoons killed, and 20 wounded; 75 horses had to be destroyed. The 
column is said to have covered 252 miles in ltf successive days ; and 
when it arrived at Farrukhabad, it had marched the last 54 miles, via 
Aliganj, in 30 hours. The infantry, who with the baggage arrived 
after the cavalry, marched J325 miles, doing an average of 18 miles a 
day. The infantry were all picked regiments. One of them, the 2/21st 
N. I . , had not a man in it over the age of 22 years. The besiegers were 
driven away from the Fort, and in an incredibly short time the country- 
side was swept clear of them. Two days after, on the 19th November 
1804 the Horse Artillery fired three royal salutes on the parade 
ground, one for the success at Fatehgarh, and the two others for victories 
over Holkar's troops in other parts of India. The despatches, telling 
of the progress of the flying column, were addressed to the Governor- 
General from Fatehgarh. The column then left, and marched to Bewar. 
Lake's exploit must have associated him peculiarly with Fatehgarh, since 
the artist, Robert Home, in executing the picture of Lord Lake and his 
staff in 1804, which now hangs in the Victoria Memorial Hall at 
Calcutta, chose to represent them as being at Fatehgarh. Evidently the 
painter had not seen the locality ; for Lord Lake, seated on a grey 
charger, has just reached the top of a steep hill, which is surmounted by 
a palm tree ! By his side on a black horse is his son, acting as aide- 
de-camp ; while the heads of the rest of the staff can just be seen, as they 
climb the side of the hill. 

After the second siege the Fort continued to be used as an arsenal, 
and a vast quantity of war munitions were stored in it. In March 1815 
the Marquess of Hastings made an inspection. Being Commander-in- 
Chief as well as Governor-General he made special note of what he. saw. 
Repairs were then going on, not only of the walls, but also of the river 
bank, which the Ganges had cut away on that side of the Fort. He 
began his inspection at daybreak on the 14th March. He noted in his diary 
that the place was a country mud fort of much extent, and that its only 
utility was to receive the civilian residents of Fatehgarh, the public 
treasure, and baggage of the various corps in the field. In this same 



70 

year, however, new activities began in the Fort. There started a long 
and memorable connection with the Gun Carriage Agency. 

The original Gun Carriage Factory was established in 1814 at 
Allahabad to supplement the Cossipore Central Factory in Lower Bengal, 
but was transferred to the Fatehgarh Fort the following year. In 1825 
the Timber Yard at Cawnpore was also moved to the Fort. In 1829 the 
whole of the Cossipore establishment and plant followed, permanent build- 
ings being erected for the factories. There is a map in the district 
records, which shows the interior arrangements at the time of the Mutiny, 
and as they had been for many years before. The Fort was preserved by 
the mutineers to be used as a cartridge Factory. Its appearance, 
therefore, has altered but little in the last hundred years. The ramparts 
had ten bastions, and a square enclosure for wood at the south-west 
corner. This wood-yard has now disappeared along with two of the 
bastions adjoining it on that front. The map shows that the house of the 
Gun Carriage Agent occupied the whole of the south-eastern area next to 
the river. The platform of the house, foundations of the room walls, the 
well, and a circular drive up to the front door are still clearly visible. 
Between the house and the southern rampart were the kitchen, servants' 
quarters, pigeon, and poultry houses. The coach house was to the north 
by the river-side wall. During the siege in the Mutiny the ladies, 
children, and other non-combatants were placed in this bungalow, which 
was then a thatched one with a high conical roof. It is also possible to 
mark exactly the spot, where Sir William Russell, the limes war corres- 
pondent, saw Sir Colin Campbell and his staff having tea in front of the 
house in April 1858. Opposite, on the other side of the courtyard, were 
two barracks, a guard room, and another bungalow, also with pigeon and 
poultry houses. The main portion of the Fort was occupied, as it is now, 
by long narrow factories, called the " half-wrought't workshops. There 
were in addition blacksmith's shops, and a steam engine from 1845 
onwards. The cemetery was enclosed as at present. Trees were well 
scattered all over the interior, and the long strip of land by the river to 
the north-east, which is now covered by factories, used as barracks, was 
under cultivation. The northern face of the Fort looked on to a grove 



77 

of shisham trees, which surrounded the magazine, and a small pond. The 
pond has disappeared. 

The actual numbers of the staff employed are not known. The Head 
Blacksmith, the Head Carpenter, and several warrant officers lived within 
the walls, as well as the Agent. The Mutiny lists contain the names of 
four overseers of the Factory. In 1875, besides the Officer in charge and 
his subaltern, there were six European overseers and 625 workmen, and 
this may be taken as some indication. At all periods warrant officers of 
the Ordnance were posted here, and must have been housed in the Fort. 

The first Gun Carriage Agent was Major Clements Brown, who was 
posted to Allahabad in June 1814 as the first agent there. In 1815 he 
removed to Fatehgarh with the whole staff from Allahabad. With the 
exception of one period of temporary absence on leave in 1818 he remained 
at Fatehgarh until 1824. He received an unusual appointment in 1821, 
when the Board of Trade with the sanction of Government nominated 
him as agent for the sale of the " Honorable Company's wines at 
Futtyghur." This officer had seen Fatehgarh before. It was his troop 
of horse artillery, the experimental troop, which fired the first shots at 
Holkar's camp in 1804. His commission bore date 1784. He saw active 
service in the Mysore, Second Rohilla, Egyptian, Lord Lake's campaigns, 
and the first and second sieges of Bhurtpore. He enjoyed the greatest 
popularity in the Army. He was regarded as the father of the Bengal 
Artillery. He once made a famous wager of fifty gold mohurs, backing 
a gunner on a dragoon horse against a dragoon on an artillery horse to 
ride between the stables of their respective lines. The dragoon lost, since 
artillery horses then were only half broken, as the gunners very well 
knew. 

In 18B2 Major-General Clements Brown, C. B., as he had then 
become, commanded headquarters at Dum Dum. Contemporaries described 
him as a most soldier-like person in appearance, a perfect horseman, a 
keen shikarri, a hearty associate at the Mess Table, and the staunch friend 
of every officer in his brigade. He died at Benares in 1838, aged 72, 
after completing fifty-four years of uninterrupted service in the Army. 
As his epitaph describes him: " He was a soldier from his youth and 



78 

delighted in his profession. He died while still in the active and zealous 
discharge of his duties." He was succeeded by the following Agents : — 

1824-1832. Major R. B. Fulton. Bom in 1788. Became Army 
Clothing Agent of the 1st Division, Fatehgarh, and died at Fatehgarh in 
1836. Buried in the Fort cemetery.

Aberdeenshire. Author of " A Journey from Meerut in India to 
London during the years 1819-1820." He went home on furlough through 
Persia, and the Caucasus. 

1843-1847. Major A. Abbott, C. B. (1804-1867). Afterwards 
Major-General. Extra A.-D.-C. to the Governor-General. Commanded

married Maria Frances Garstin at Fatehgarh. 

1847-1853. Lieut.-Colonel J. Alexander, C B. (1803-1888). After- 
wards Major-General Sir James Alexander, K. C. B., Commandant, Royal 
Bengal Artillery. Arrived in India, 1821. Siege of Bhurtpore, 1st

1st Burma, and Arakan Wars. N. W. Frontier, 1849-1850. The des- 
cendants of Isan Chandar Deb have interesting letters by this officer 
enquiring after the fate of furniture left by him and Colonel Alexander 
in the Fort just before the Mutiny. Colonel Fordyce was on leave, when 
the Mutiny broke out. 



70 

1857. Major A. Robertson. Officiating for Colonel Fordyce. 
Died on the !7th September, 1857, at Karhar on the bank of the Ganges, 
of a wound received in the attack by the mutineers on the boats at Manpur 
Katri. The tomb is maintained by Government. 

The story of the third siege is full of interest, and has been told by 
one of the two survivors, Mr. Gavin Jones. A copy of his account is in 
the library of the Officers' Mess of the 10/7th Rajput Regiment. The 
other survivor was Mr. David Churcher, who died in 1908, and is buried 
in the new cemetery. Reference should be made to " Fatehgarh and the 
Mutiny " for a detailed history of this siege. 

One of the last surviving records of the time just before the Mutiny 
deals with an old trouble of the Fatehgarh residents, which was ever 
recurring. In 1855 the river was very low in the hot weather, and the 
ground beneath the Fort, which was left by the receding water, was sown 
with melons. The manuring of these crops resulted in swarms of flies. 
The Agent protested against the nuisance. The melon-growers were then 
summarily ejected from the vicinity of the Fort, and paid Rs. 55 as 
compensation. 



CHAPTER IV. 

HUSAINPUR AND CIRCULAR ROAD. 



NO area in Fatehgarh has changed so completely as that in the 
vicinity of the Fort; for it has been disengaged from the mass 
of bazars, which formerly surrounded it. There was always a ghat called 
Qilaghat; and Sher Dil Khan, the builder of the Fort in 1720, was 
granted the monopoly of charging transit duties on all merchandise 
which passed that way. There must always, therefore, have been a certain 
number of boatmen, who lived by the ford, and formed the nucleus of 
the village, called Husainpur. The bazar grew up in the eighteenth 
century, and was named after the artillery, as contrasted with Fatehgarh 
Town, which was the Sudder bazar of the infantry corps of the Temporary 
Brigade. It was also called the Khalassi bazar to show its connection 
with the khalassis of the artillery. Its very convenient situation on the 
river bank turned it into a large trading community, including numbers 
of boatmen. In 1830 the population exceeded ten thousand, who lived 
in densely crowded blocks, traversed by narrow lanes, opposite the Fort 
gates. The nearness of these houses to the Fort was a source of great 
anxiety to the besieged during the investment by the mutineers. After 
the Mutiny, consequently, the whole area was acquired by Government, 
and the houses knocked down by elephants. 

At the water's edge is the bathing ghat, built according to the 
foundation stone, in 1848 by Babu Isan Chandar Deb, then head clerk of 
the Gun Carriage Agency. His house, next to the Military Works store- 
house, still stands on a space formerly packed with houses. It is interest- 
ing as a Mutiny relic; for here the mutineers posted one of their two 
guns, covered by picked marksmen. It was brought to bear on the 
nearest rampart, and was unsuccessful in breaching it ; but by sending 
its balls over into the interior of the Fort, the gun was able to damage 
the Agent's house, in which the non-combatants were sheltering. Babu 
Isan Chandar Deb afterwards set up a shop and canteen at this place. 



81 

Closely adjacent is the square enclosure of the Military Works 
Engineer with angle turrets and a small mosque inside. This building 
was a serai constructed in 1824 for travellers, by Nawab Hakim Mehdi 
Ali Khan, the exiled Vizier of Oudh, who made Fatehgarh his home from 
1822 to 1837. When Fatehgarh was retaken by the force under Sir 
Colin Campbell, the serai was occupied as an Officers' Mess ; and on the 
26th April 1858 Sir William Russell notes in his diary that he had 
breakfast just by the mosque in the centre. The Bhatiyaras, or inn- 
keepers, were ejected afterwards, and Government made the building 
into a storehouse. Opposite the old serai is the road over the rifle range 
to Naugaon. This was lined with trees in 1826, and previous to that 
date the environs of the Fort were bare. In the midst of a wood stood 
the house of Martin, the indigo planter. It was later the Commissariat 
Yard, near to the spot where the road crosses the present range. At the 
south-western corner of the Fort, and about opposite to Isan Chandar's 
house, was a Hindoo shrine belonging to Phulmati and Hardeo. 

The space, now partly covered by the Maude Lines, where up to 
forty years ago three companies from a British regiment at Agra used to 
be quartered, was the location of the artillery corps in the eighteenth 
and first decade of the nineteenth century. The artillery parade ground 
was the open ground, which is east of the present Church and the War 
Memorial of the 7th Rajput Regiment. It is now crossed by a road 
leading to the Maude Lines from Regent Road. The strength of the 
artillery dwindled after the 2nd Mahratta War. As their lines contract- 
ed, bungalows and other buildings were set up; and what little artillery 
remained was pushed by these encroachments towards its parade ground. 
Colonel Vanrenan took a large area in 1810 for his new bazar, now called 
the B. I. bazar. Eventually the parade ground itself contracted, the 
Mint house being constructed on a portion of it; and the place which 
in 1846 was known locally as the "Top Khana", consisted only of a row 
of huts (nearly in front of the regimental hockey ground by the Church). 
It correctly marks, however, that position first occupied by the artillery 
of the Temporary Brigade "in front of the right of the line", a position 
which was soon exchanged for more comfortable quarters in the Fort. 



82 

By 1795 the Artillery had been ousted from the Fort, which was then 
becoming an arsenal, and was called "The Magazine". It was necessary 
to provide new accommodation as quickly as possible, since the strict 
outlines of the camp of the Temporary Brigade had become modified by 
the lapse of eighteen years, and the place of the artillery in the original 
lay-out of the Brigade was being hemmed in by the Husainpur bazar. 
The Q. M. G. ordered the construction of two ranges of artillery barracks. 
6,000 sonat rupees were advanced to Major Pringie, the Barrack Master, 
in January 1795. The works were finished by September at the large 
cost of 21,387 sonat rupees. Major Pringie also constructed a "cook 
room", store house, guard room, and bungalows for artillery sergeants. 
All these buildings were thatched. An extra bungalow was built for 
the Sergeant-Major, details of which are given, and indicate the size of 
residence considered sufficient in those days for non-commissioned officers. 
It must be remembered that the residences of the officers were not very 
much better, and it is therefore possible to understand how seventy 
houses could have been packed into the narrow limits of Cantonments. 
The bungalow in question was 30 feet long and 20 feet broad. The roof 
was of the usual thatch. The walls, 141 feet high by 2i feet thick, were 
of mud, and their interior surface was washed with fine chenam plaster. 
The floors were constructed of brick. A partition wall, 12 feet high, 
divided this abode into two rooms. The thatch rested on 22 pillars, 
which placed at a distance of 81 feet from the house walls, made a 
verandah of that width on all four sides. The cost of building this house 
was 685 sonat rupees for materials, and 310 for wages of the labourers. 
A similar bungalow was made the next year for a N. C. O., called the 
Deputy Q. M. G's. Sergeant. It has not been possible to fix the position 
of these buildings accurately ; but it is known that they lay on the nor- 
thern side of the main road to the Fort, and on both sides of the road, 
which now runs across the Rifle Range to Ghatia Ghat. For a great 
many years after the disappearance of the artillery their site was called the 
"Khalassi Lines". The artillery workshops remained as before in the Fort. 
The resolution of the Governor-General's Council dated 4th August 
1777 ordered one company of artillery to be sent from each of three 



83 

brigades. Accordingly the Temporary Brigade received the 1st Company 
under Captain-Lieutenant Hill, the 2nd under Capt. -Lieutenant Sampson, 
and the 3rd under Capt. -Lieutenant Harris. These companies were then 
numbered 6, 7, and 8, the whole corps being commanded by Major 
Patrick Duff. There was a Lieutenant attached named David Wood- 
burne, who was still at Fatehgarh ten years later in command of a 
company from the 2nd Battalion of Artillery. In 1787 the force had 
decreased to one company. From 1795 to 1803 it rose to two companies 
from the 3rd Battalion, and by 1809 one company was again considered 
sufficient. Very shortly after this date, the artillery disappeared along 
with the cavalry, the frontier having shifted from Fatehgarh to the Agra 
and Muttra line. Henceforth, right up to the Mutiny, there were only 
two guns with a detachment of Foot Artillery, stationed permanently 
in the Fort. These two guns falling into the hands of the mutineers, 
played a prominent part in the siege of that place in 1857. 

In the eighteenth century the establishment of golandaz, or " hurlers 
of cannon balls," as they were called, consisted usually of 3 British and 
4 Indian officers, 3 British and 16 Indian N. C. Os., and 80 gunners to 
each company. There were six companies of lascars, or khalassis, in 
addition. The organisation was continually changing. At the very first 
each company had one captain-lieutenant, and a lieutenant-fireworker 
only ; and most of the staff work and training was entrusted to ten British 
sergeants. Each battalion of infantry had its own guns, which were kept 
with the battalion in its lines. They were distinct from the brigade 
artillery. In 1784 a company of European artillery appeared at Fateh- 
garh, but not for long. Until the " Mud War " of 1802-03, when Lord 
Lake decided to reduce several strongholds with mud walls in and around 
the District, the artillery at Fatehgarh saw little active service, and it 
was chiefly employed against Zemindars' forts. A record of 1803 
describes the Indargarh Fort of Hannu Prasad, then in the Etawah 
District, as a mud structure with 16 bastions, and surrounded by a ditch 
60 feet deep, and 60 feet broad. The forts of Sasni, Kachaura, and 
Thatia, reduced in the Mud War, were of this description, but possibly 
bigger. Lieut. -Col. James Gordon, commanding the FatehgArh artillery 



84 

in 1802, lost his life in these operations. It had been foretold by a 
fortune teller that he would die in his first action, and it so happened 
that for a long period of his service he was employed in arsenals in 
Lower Bengal. Having survived the bombardment and capture of 
Bijaigarh Fort, he was engaged in inspecting stores of captured ammuni- 
tion inside the Fort, when an explosion occurred in the magazine, and 
killed him. 

The artillery practice ground was at Dahlia, a village which is four 
miles distant from the Fort on the other side of the Ganges. In 1820 the 
Magistrate cleared the range of trees, which had grown up, and gave 
offence by his summary methods. This is the sole mention of the place 
in the records, and the only description is that given by William Daniell 
under date the 7th January 1789. He writes, "Un., (L e. y uncle or 
Thomas Daniell), and self set out very early in our palanquins and 
arrived at Capt, Montagu's tent on Djlia plain abt. 8 o.c. Spent 
the day with Capt. M. (Edward Montagu. 2nd Bn. Artillery 
1787. Died on 9th May 1799 of wounds received at the siege of 
Seringapatam). Capt. M., Un., and self rode round the plain on an 
elephant. Delia is the most beautiful plain we have seen in India. A 
number of delightful groups of trees cover it, which are situated in such 
a manner as to appear to have been planted like an English park, which 
it much resembles. Were entertained in seeing the soldiers exercise the 
artillery guns. Returned to Fatehgarh at 6 o.c. Un. and self played a 
few games of billiards in the eveiling." 

On the site of the present canteen was the bungalow of " Sadder 
Line Sahib," an appellation which it is difficult to 'interpret. In the 
eighteenth century the official called the Commissary of Bazars was 
sometimes referred to as a " Line Sahib," but in this case a local tradition 
has come to light, which suggests that the name " Sutherland " is meant. 
Charles Sutherland, merchant and agent, appeared in 1845. He was 
killed at Manpur Katri, when escaping in the boats during the Mutiny. 
His wife and two of his children, however, were massacred along with 
other captives by the well in the compound of the Church. The story is 
that Miss Sutherland offered to purchase their lives by revealing a hidden 



85 

store of money in her father's bungalow, which was close-by. There is 
no actual truth in the story ; but it is suggestive of the fact that the 
Sutherland's bungalow stood near the scene of the massacre. The 
" Sudder Line Sahib's" bungalow certainly did stand within sight of it.' 

The topography of this area is very obscure. The Western side of 
the road, stretching from the present canteen towards the Quarter Guard, 
was lined by small bungalows and compounds, relating to which several 
sale deeds are in existence. It is certain that next to the Sudder Line 
Sahib was the property of Mrs. S. Clark, or Matesia Bibi, the Mohamedan 
wife of a Deputy Collector in 1824. Three years before, John Clark was 
a trader, and his wealth was attested by the ownership of two other pro- 
perties. Mrs. Clark's chief title to fame, however, lay in the fact that 
she built a remarkable mosque, which was situated in the small enclosure 
in the south-eastern corner of her compound here. There is also a story 
to the effect that Mr. Clark built the edifice on the model of one at 
Mecca, in order to prevent his wife from leaving him to go on pilgrimage 
to that place. On the front of the building was a Persian inscription, 
the translation of which is as follows : " Blessed be this mosque, built by 
Mi's. John Clark. It matches the Kaaba exactly. When the maker of 
dates searched his mind for its chronogram, the answer was : Oh, what a 
grand and imposing mosque!" The chronogram concealed in the words 
of the last line gave the date 1249 A. H., or 1830 A. D. 

Behind these two bungalows of the Sudder Line Sahib and Mrs 
Clark, were situated the Camel Lines, or Shuturkhana. Unless they were 
connected with the Commissariat it is difficult to guess the nature of their 
employment. At Shahjahanpur there is a similar Shuturkhana behind the 
District Courts, where camels were kept for taking the District Magistrate's 
correspondence over the district. It may well be that the camels kept in 
these lines were used for a similar purpose, since the District Courts were 
for many years on the site of the present Railway Engine Shed, and not 
so very far away. 

Further to the south, a semi-circular lane surrounded five compounds 
and a garden, a space which is now covered by barracks. The eastern- 
most property towards the Kasim Bagh cemetery, with garden attached, 



86 

was a house belonging to Sir Edward Colebrooke, Bart., Joint Commis- 
sioner for the Ceded Provinces, 1809-22. He was dismissed the service 
in 1880, and died 1888. His brother was the celebrated Oriental scholar. 
Colebrooke is always described in the Fatehgarh sale deeds by his full 
titles, " Roshan-ud-Daula, Zia-ul-Mulk, Mr. Colebrooke, Sahib Bahadur, 
Mansur-i-Jang." On his departure to act as Resident at Delhi, he left 
this property to his wife Nau Ratan, who sold it to Nawab Hakim Mehdi 
Ali Khan. In the fifties it was held on lease by Reginald Orlando Kew, 
the Postmaster, who was killed on the parade ground in the Mutiny. Kew 
established a saltpetre factory on the premises, and the orange tree 
orchard was ruined. Only the brick walls of the house were standing 
after the Mutiny. North of the Colebrooke property lived Mr. Meikle, 
of whom no further notice has been found but that he was a Portuguese, 
or Goanese, as he would now be styled. He was most probably a clerk. 
South of Mrs. Clark's was a larger compound looking on. to the Fort Road. 
This belonged to the Mohamedan wife of Lieut.-Colonel Samuel Palmer, 
Officer Commanding at Fatehgarh in 1809-10. She was named Khairan, 
and bought the house in 1816 for Rs. 2,001 from Westcomb Jacob, a 
shopkeeper from Agra, who at the beginning of the century also set up 
shop here. This same Jacob sold a garden, behind the present Military 
works godown, to Tom John, a son of Sir Edward Colebrooke, a person 
who was always known as John Sahib. South of Mrs. Palmer's was Mr. 
Jay, a merchant, and west of his place was a triangular compound also 
belonging to Mrs. Palmer, which must be assigned either to a clerk named 
Emmanuel Anthony, or to a merchant of the name of Storr. Across the 
road south of Mr. Jay's was a house in which one of these two lived. The 
exact location of these families is not known, but these two houses are the 
only ones which they could have inhabited. 

The Anthony family was devoted to Government service, and they 
are mentioned constantly from 1880 to 1861. There were M. Anthony 
Senior and Junior, and E. Anthony. They signed the memorial of 1829, 
and the child of Adam Anthony was buried in the Kasim Bagh cemetery 
in 1861. The name does not appear in the Mutiny lists, and the family 
must have left the Station for a time. Curiously, the earliest signature 



87 

of M. Anthony is that which he scratched in 1828 on the wall of Nawab 
Ahmad Khan's tomb in the Bihisht Bagh in the City. There are two 
other names close by his, one recording for posterity the visit of Robert 
Morris in 1793, and the second that of John Macklin in 1818, the person 
who was Head Clerk of the Collector's office, and was killed at Cawnpore 
in the Mutiny. Of Storr little is known. He bought up four acres of 
the old Cavalry Lines at Rakha, and was an indigo broker and trader, 
mentioned in the Fatehgarhnama in company with the wealthiest firms of 
indigo traders in the District. At the beginning of 1858 all these houses, 
from that of the Sudder Line Sahib, down to Mr. Storr's house were 
levelled to make room for British Infantry barracks, by order of the Com- 
mander-in-Chief, Sir Colin Campbell. Up to that year they were outside 
the old Cantonment boundary. 

A portion of Husainpur stretched along the Ganges Bank as far as 
Hospital Ghat, and included the tract of land behind No. £ Bungalow, 
where now are the ruined tombs of the Moghal princes. This plot was 
known as the Shahzadas' garden. Prince Muzaffar Bakht, the grandson 
of the Delhi Emperor, Shah Alam, had been interned at Benares; but he 
was implicated with Vizier AM in the murder of Mr. Cherry, the Resi- 
dent there, and was sent to Fatehgarh in 1803. He died in 1828, and left 
three sons, who owned this garden in equal shares. In 1858 the widow 
of the third son, Makhdoom Bakht, made protest to the Magistrate that 
the Barrack Master was demolishing the family tombs in the garden. 
The Barrack Master denied it. In any case, the lady had no proprietary 
rights in the garden; for she had sold her share to Maharaja Dhuleep 
Singh through Mr. Buller, the Judge, in 1852. 

South of the Quarter Guard of the 10/7th Rajput Regiment, on both 
sides of the Circular Road, was the infantry rifle range, which in the days 
of the " Brown Bess " was not required to be of any extent. 

The Memorial Church of All Souls commemorates the victims of the 
Mutiny, and in particular those who were murdered on this spot, and are 
interred in the well in the compound. The story of the Mutiny is too 
extensive to be related here, and a full account will be found in 
" Fatehgarh and the Mutiny ". The compound of the Church, briefly, 



88 

covers the site of J. R. Madden's " yellow bungalow '". He belonged to 
the Clothing Factory. By the house door were murdered ten Eurasian and 
Indian Christians. Outside the compound, and just beneath the Memorial 
well, was a row of huts, against the walls of which twenty-two women and 
children were killed. The bodies were buried in a disused well of 
Mr. Madden's, just behind the huts. The memorial in red sand-stone, set 
up by the Government of the North-West Provinces, stands directly over it. 

Circular Road had a different alignment before the Mutiny. It ran 
in a much wider sweep to the west, up to the present Commissariat 
Godown, on the further side of Colonelganj, and the latter village was left 
isolated on the parade ground. The portion of this, road from the Commis- 
sariat godown to the City Road is still to be seen, and is bordered by fine 
trees planted by Mr. Shore, the Judge, in 1834. It gives a good idea of 
the appearance of the roads in the pre-Mutiny Cantonments. 

The Commissariat buildings have been called the Rum Godown, the 
Roti Godown, and by other names since the Mutiny ; but before that 
event the place was named the Shahzada's house, and was under the 
charge of the Collector. Though altered in size, the premises still contain 
the oldest house in Fatehgarh, in nearly the same condition as in 1819, 
when it was constructed by Government for the residence of the Moghal 
prince, Muzaffar Bakht. The old plan shows a long oblong compound, 
enclosed by mud walls, and divided into two halves In the front half 
was a bungalow with well and servants quarters, a few trees, and flanked 
by flower beds arranged in geometrical designs. The bungalow recon- 
structed is now the Military Engineer's rest house. Well and trees still 
remain. The surrounding walls and outhouses, however, have gone. The 
second half was the private garden, and the house proper of the prince, 
which up to recently was used as a primary school. Its verandah is 
bricked up, and the ornamental arches within are covered with whitewash. 
Behind extended the garden laid out in formal fashion. It is now mostly 
under cultivation, and it is partly covered by a yard enclosed by concrete 
store houses. 

Prince Muzaffar Bakht, who had been interned in Fatehgarh since 
1803 never liked the house. He later obtained permission to live on the 



89 

bank of the Ganges. The premises could be put to no good use, and 
were generally empty. During the great famine of 1837-38 an aged 
poor house was established here, and a distributing centre of food and 
money set up. No one would buy the place. Mr. Robinson (Collector 
1835-40) tried to turn it into a lunatic asylum ; but Government would 
not agree. For a time it received the overflow of prisoners from the 
Jail; and the records show that 29 separate cells had been built in the 
garden. It was also the Jail Hospital just before the Mutiny, and was in 
a bad state of repair. The bungalow, however, was inhabited by Joint 
Magistrates and other officials at odd times. 

From the Shahzada's house the old Circular Road proceeded straight 
to the Racquet Court, which was standing in 1846, and onward to Rakha 
through the trading quarter of Fatehgarh, where lived merchants and 
shopkeepers from the eighteenth century up to 1857. In 1794 there were 
established in the Civil Lines and Circular Road — D. Grueber, J. Stewart, 
Jas. Foreman, L. Paul, Rob. Carshore, and J. Warren, indigo planters : 
Rob. Bathurst, Charles and John Bathurst, Thos. Bush, J. Newman, 
W.. Robertson, and W. Wattell, traders: J. Barr, Commission Agent: 
A. Elliot. Jas. Cox, and T. Bellew, shopkeepers. Robert Carshore came 
in 1782, and traded in cloth as well as indigo; while the first shopkeeper 
was Andrew Elliot, 1785. There were not only over fifty British officers 
in Cantonments, but after 1802 a large number of European and Eurasian 
officials in the Mint, Ordnance, Paymaster's, Commissioner's and District 
offices, as well as indigo planters, to cater for. 

In 1835 no less than eighteen indigo planters can be identified at 
Fatehgarh, of whom three or four lived at Mehndi Ghat by Kanauj. Two 
auctioneers, Brierly and Morgan, were doing business ; and Mr. C. Braggs 
earned his living as a musician. Ten years before, Christian Lundt was 
of the same profession, although other Lundts were manufacturing indigo. 
Reid and Ives were tent makers. Fatehgarh tents are often mentioned in 
contemporary memoirs, and were as well known as they are now. Messrs. 
Morton, Jennings and Jacob had general shops. Saltpetre refiners were 
numerous, and many indigo planters carried on this business in addition 
to their own. Several limited companies worked on a large scale. Bush, 



90 

Packard &amp; Co. for example, employed three European Assistants. 
MacArthur, Moir &amp; Co. went in for saltpetre refining; and one Civil 
Surgeon, Dr. Julius Jeffreys, found the line profitable enough for floating 
a company, called Jeffreys &amp; Co. Similarly Mr. Mercer, who was re- 
gistrar, subordinate judge, money lender, real estate agent, and boon 
companion at all dinners, founded a business under his own name. There 
were Bathurst, Bush &amp; Co., Urquhart &amp; Co., Gavonei's Indigo Works 
under Mr. P. O'Connor; Thos. Kerrod &amp; Co. of Cawnpore ; Pyle's Mineral 
Water Factory; Macintosh &amp; Co. of Calcutta. Even Nawab Hakim 
Mehdi Ali Khan started a business in the town, and financed a factory for 
weaving Kashmir shawls. In 1822 W. Morton announced he was a free 
trader. He did not last long. 

Under the Company's administration there were stringent rules for 
non-officials about taking out permits to live up country. There is a permit 
of this nature in the district records written in beautiful copy plate, and 
issued from Calcutta. It allows Mr. Bassel Muirhead in 1830 to live at 
Fatehgarh under a permit according to Act 53 of George III. All Europeans 
had to obtain this permit, and deposit it in the Civil Court for record. 

In the early nineteenth century Europeans were not allowed to lease, 
or own, land in their own name. Indigo planters usually did so through 
a servant, or made engagements with zemindars to cultivate indigo for 
them after giving advances. Many Fatehgarh planters had large establish- 
ments in the country, like Martin at Shamsabad, where his " godown " is 
still known, or the Maxwells and Packard &amp; Co. at Mehndi Ghat. The 
remains of the factory at this place are worth visiting. They are in a 
splendid state of preservation. The first planter was Laurence Paul. He 
came in 1777. David Churcher was the last, and he is mentioned as still 
working in the seventies. Other prominent planters were Paul, Stewart, 
Warren, Lundt, Carshore, Macdonald, Bush, Bell, Hand, Packard, 
Maxwell, F. de Seran Dubois, Grueber, Gropen, Churcher, Bennett, Birch, 
Cave, Coles, Gardner, Garton, Moreau, Picken, Robeson, Wright, Simpson, 
Martin, Mercer, Bruce, and Gilmore. 

J. Brierly's house was behind the church. It is still inhabited. 
Brierly was auctioneer, shopkeeper, and tent maker from 1834 onwards. 



91 

In 1848 he had to mortgage the property to Mr. Kew, the Postmaster. 
He, his brother, and both their families escaped in the boats to Cawnpore, 
and were killed by the mutineers. He was a well-known resident ; for 
he was in command of one of the boats, and is several times mentioned in 
the Mutiny account. In 1859 the ruins of the house and shop were 
bought by Mr. Durand, tent maker. ■ 

Opposite Brierly's place lived the Hine family. Wilfrid Hine (buried 
in Kasim Bagh cemetery) owned two houses. He lived actually on the 
site of the Inspection Bungalow of the Public Works Department. The 
house next door he sold to Edmond Jennings, shopkeeper, for Rs. 1,500 
in 1840. This house has disappeared, and the space is empty. Jennings' 
father lived in Cantonments in 1829. They both were traders. A Mrs. 
Jennings in 1834 lived on the Company Garden site. 

Next to Jennings was Joseph Morgan, the auctioneer and shopkeeper. 
The house still stands in fine condition. Morgan was bom in Fatehgarh 
in 1791, and left just before the Mutiny, selling out to S. Mercer. 
Exactly opposite on the other side of the road was the bungalow of J. C. 
Pyle, the manager of the flourishing mineral water factory. South of 
Morgan's property was a building used as a hospital. The Military 
Police occupied it as their headquarters in 1858, since it had not been 
damaged in the Mutiny, This Police unit was named the "Fatehgarh 
District Police Battalion." Its first commandant was Lieutenant G. R. 
Hennessey. The place is called at present " Shora ki Kothi," and for 
many years was used as a salt refinery. It is falling into ruin. 

The last compound on this side, stretching up to the railway line, 
was that of Mr. Ives, the tent maker. There were really two compounds, 
the first of which had three factory buildings in it. A few wells are to 
be seen, which belong to them. He and his family escaped in the boats 
from the Fort, and were massacred at Cawnpore. In the Urdu records 
his name is written " AIB Sahib," an example of the difficulty of identi- 
fying old residents. 

Opposite Ives 1 factory was a garden, and south of the garden stood 
the bungalow of John Clark, (merchant), first mentioned in 1821. In 
1836 the house certainly belonged to Mrs. Francis Ives; for she mortgaged 



02 

it for Rs. 900 to Kanhaya Lai, and states in the deed that she bought it 
from Dr. Neil, a regimental surgeon It continued to be known as 
Clark's house notwithstanding. After the Mutiny it became the local 
Masonic Lodge, called in the Vernacular the " Jadughar," or house of 
magic. There are no traces of this place left. The road continued to 
Rakha, and had no other houses in it. 



CHAPTER V. 

TOMBS AND MONUMENTS. 



DURING the earliest period burials were often made in the compound 
of the house. Accordingly there were two such burials at Fateh- 
garh. Near the site of the old Club is a small enclosure beneath a 
tamarind tree of some age, containing a tomb in Mohamedan fashion, 
which is obviously that of a Christian, since apart from the epitaph its 
direction is east and wes. Its good preservation is due to the bearer of 
the old Club, who always had it placed in order at the time of annual re- 
pairs. The inscription is : " Sacred to the memory of Catherine P. who 
departed this life on the 525th August in the year of our Lord 1798, aged 
36 years." 

The name should be Catherine Paul, and she belonged to the family 
of a trader, named Laurence Paul, who came here about 1777 during the 
settling of the Temporary Brigade into its new quarters. There is little 
notice of this family in the records, and Paul seems to have died about 
1810. He came out to India in a French ship in 1776, and may be 
related to the Paul family of Calcutta. A Doctor Thomas Paul died at 
Calcutta in 1746, and three ladies of the family married Bengal Civilians, 
one of whom was the G. F. Cherry murdered at Benares in 1799. In 1790 
Paul was appointed attorney for one Da Souza of Calcutta, who had pro- 
cured the arrest of an absconding agent, named Hynne. Hynne had been 
entrusted with a boat load of merchandise and wines to sell at Patna, but 
finding the opportunity good, fled to Fatehgarh, and set up shop in the 
Cantonment bazar. On Hynne's arrest by the Officer Commanding, Paul 
took over the shop, and settled Da Souza's affairs. The Pauls, apart from 
this, can only be traced in the Registrar's Office at Fatehgarh. They 
owned two bungalows in the locality, residing in that which subsequently 
housed the library of the old Club up to 1925. South of this bungalow 
the foundations of the other can still be traced in the compound of No. 4 
Bungalow, and opposite No. 20. The tomb of Catherine Paul was thus 



94 

midway between the two. Laurenee Paul's daughter-in law sold both 
properties in 1849 to the Revd. Gopinath Nande of the American Pres- 
byterian Mission. She is styled Musammat Jaube Paul in the sale deeds, 
and after this date all trace of her is lost. 

The oldest tomb in Fatehgarh is in the compound of the District 
Courts. It is a tall square monument by the roadside, and bears this 
inscription : " Sacred to the memory of Thomas Hamilton Esq., Head 
Surgeon, who died 12th August A. D. 1788, aged about 50 years. This 
monument is erected by Major S. Farmer, Executor." Both Hamilton 
and Farmer joined the Company's service in 1768. Hamilton was the 
first Head Surgeon of the General Hospital, set up by order of Govern- 
ment in 1786, and he arrived at Fatehgarh early in 1787. The bank of 
the Ganges was at that time lined by private residences, where now are 
the District Courts; and Hamilton's tomb was. probably made in the 
compound of the house, which he inhabited. Farmer's court-martial in 
1783 has been noticed. In 1787 he commanded the 23rd Battalion of 
Sepoys. He died at Cawnpore in 1794. His wife had the quaint names 
of " Susanna Robiniana Brown." 

The old Fort cemetery is the chief landmark of local history. Like 
all cemeteries of the period, it is overcrowded. A profusion of clumsy 
obelisks and pyramids presents itself to the eye, and serried ranks of 
monuments are overlooked by Colonel Hickman's memorial, which with 
its dome and columns is not without a certain dignity of its own. Less 
damage than might have been expected was committed in the Mutiny. 
It will be noticed that, while the tombs themselves are still in their 
original condition, some tablets, bearing epitaphs of the dead, have been 
removed from the niches which contained them. These tablets, which 
were of more enduring stone, and were inserted into a side of the tomb 
after its construction, were deliberately picked out by the mutineers to 
be used as stones for grinding curry powder. According to the 
inscriptions by the sculptors, which are always to be found in the bottom 
righthand corner of the tablet, the stone employed for tombs and tablets 
came from Calcutta, Chunar, and Agra. The earliest decipherable 
inscription is on a tablet of 1806, and indicates the sculptor to have 



95 

been "George Delmedick." Unfortunately the place of origin is not 
given. From 1819 up to 1835 a firm named Llewelyn &amp; Co., or 
Simpson and Llewelyn, or J. Llewelyn &amp; Co., of Calcutta, furnished the 
stone for the epitaphs, usually of a blue colour. One or two tablets, 
notably the fine one pertaining to the tomb of Colonel Hickman (1828), 
are by T. Plaw. After 1840 stone was procured from T. D'Gruyther of 
Chunar, certainly a relation of the Deputy Collector of that name, who 
resided in Fatehgarh at the time, and from Blanchett and Suntook of 
Agra. Other variations of this latter firm were Blanchett &amp; Co., and 
Suntoke and Son. 

Many tablets, chiefly relating to eighteenth century burials, have 
been affixed to the cemetery walls; but there are still a great many tombs, 
which cannot be assigned to any particular burial, although the names of 
all those persons who have been interred in this spot since 1777, are 
known, In most cases details of their lives and services have been obtained 
from Mr. Blunt's " Christian Tombs in the U. P.", and from Major 
Hodson's u List of Officers of the Bengal Army ". A list of the memorial 
inscriptions, which are to be seen in the cemetery, will first be given. 

The following inscriptions Nos. 1 to 18, were picked up and affixed 
to the cemetery wall after the Mutiny. 

1. "To the memory of. R.Cherry 1829. Aged 

also also " 

Robert Cherry was married to Elizabeth Ball on the 21st 
April 1829. Nothing further is known about him. 

2. " Sacred to the memory of Captain B. Rose, who departed 
this life on the 8th September 1801, aged 36 years."

subordinate judge in 1833, and for a time acted as the Judge of 



96 

Mainpuri. He. was an integral part of the life of the station in 

the thirties and forties. The registers show that, while he 

registered the transactions of others, he himself was no less busy 

in buying and selling. He lived, 1823 to 1828, at Kasim Bagh ; 

behind No. 4 Bungalow ; and lastly on the Ganges Bank, near 

GhatiaGhat.

memoration of an affectionate wife." 

Joseph Morgan, auctioneer and shopkeeper, married Mary 
Mathews in 1813 at Fatehgarh. His house stands today in the 
Circular Road. He was the son of Joseph Morgan, a carpenter 
and native of Philadelphia, U.S.A., who first appeared at 
Fatehgarh in 1790, and in 1807 was buried in the Fort cemetery. 
He was doubtless the first American inhabitant of the Station. 
Joseph Morgan, junior, was bom in 1791. At the age of four 
years he was baptised by the Revd. Tho. Clarke along with three 
. of his sisters, Mary (aged three), Elizabeth (aged two), and 
Hannah (aged one), on the 5th April 1795. Mary was married 
to P. Marks of the 4th Coy. 2nd Bn. Artillery in 1806 ; Hannah 
at the early age of thirteen became the wife of John Swinkman, 



07 

a comrade of Marks; and lastly Elizabeth in 1810 was married 
to Friedrick Han of the 3rd Coy., 1st Bn. Artillery. Joseph 
lived on at Fatehgarh for many years. He is last mentioned in 
the records of 1846. A son of his, named Charles Morgan, 
married Martha Cray in 1844. 

8. " To the memory of Mr. Samuel Skardon, who died October 
30th, 1788 A.D., aged 57 years. This tomb was erected by his

ment, who received a brevet commission as lieutenant-fireworker in 
the artillery. One of his daughters married Lieut. -Col. War ton-,

The following inscriptions are affixed to undamaged tombs. 

19. " Armine Simcoe Henry Mountain. Col. and Adjt.- 
General. February 1854. In memory of a loved husband to 
replace the memorial erected A. D. 1854 by the Commander-in-Chief 
and the Head-Quarter Staff and destroyed A. 1). 1857 during the 
rebellion of the Bengal Army." 

Of Huguenot origin Col. Mountain was born at Quebec 
in 1797. He received a commission as ensign in the 96th 
Regiment in 1815. After serving with the 52nd and the 76th, 
he arrived in India in 1829 with the 26th Cameronians, a 
regiment which he eventually commanded. His aptitude and 
proficiency as a soldier marked him out for early promotion. He 
was Adjutant-General to the China Expeditionary Force in 
1840, and was wounded during the operations. After some stay 
in England he returned to India in 1847 to take up the appoint- 
ment of Military Secretary to Lord Dalhousie. The following 
year saw the outbreak of the second Sikh War. Col. Mountain's 
ability was recognised by the conferment upon him of the 
command of the 4th Brigade, which he led through the actions 
of Chillianwalla and Gujrat. He was afterwards selected for 
the post of Adjutant-General in India. 

The circumstances of his untimely death will be found in 
the memoir of Col. Mountain, which was published later by his 
widow. It was she who replaced the stone over the grave in the 
Fort cemetery. Fragments of the old stone, which was smashed 
in the Mutiny, will be found affixed to the cemetery wall, and 
close by the grave. It appears that in January 1854, while on 
tour with Sir William Gomm, the Commander-in-Chief, Col. 
Mountain fell ill on the road between Cawnpore and Fatehgarh. 
On reaching Fatehgarh he was taken to the house (now the 



loo 

Officer's Mess) of Doctor Login, the guardian of Maharaja 
Dhuleep Singh, where he died on the 8th February. 

The funeral was publicly celebrated. Army Headquarters" 
clerks carried the coffin from the house door to the Park gates, 
and again from the gate of the Fort to the grave. A gun car- 
riage served as bier over the intervening road. The Union Jack, 
which had hung at half-mast before the Commander-in-Chiefs 
tent on the camping ground, was the pall. The bands of the 2nd 
Grenadiers and the 28th Regiment played Handel's funeral march 
alternatively during the progress. The Headquarters staff, all 
military forces in Fatehgarh and the favourite charger, ridden 
through the Sikh War, followed in the procession. The route 
was lined by thousands of the population. The Rev. J. Kellner, 
chaplain of Mainpuri, read the service ; and while three volleys 
were fired, Sir William Gomm and Maharaja Dhuleep Singh stood 
by the grave side. Besides this monument, a brass tablet was set 
up in the Church at Simla, and a window was dedicated to 
Colonel Mountain's memory in a church at Quebec. 

20. " In memory of Lieut. Stuart Douglas, H. M. 82nd Regt.,

January to 25th April 1858, relieving the 8th Foot. The 
regiment under Colonel Hale was part of the force under Sir 
Colin Campbell, which after the battle of the Kali Nadi, 
re-occupied Fatehgarh on the 3rd January. Lieutenant Stuart 
thus died on the day his regiment marched into the Fort.

survived her. From this no outward solicitations could withdraw her, 
but opportunities of more extended good which that she was diligent 
to seek out and employ many instances of well-directed benevolence

example of true humility, she rested in peace on the 5th day of June

records for thy sake, stranger, who shalt come after, that thou mayest

now on this spot were in his garden. 

John Moore Jones was not in Government service, and the

his plantation near the City, and a residence near the Raja of 
Tirwa's house by the new Police Lines. He was born on the 9th

The Kasim Bagh cemetery, surrounded by walls, will be found 
behind the Maude Lines. The mutineers wrought such havoc here that 
it is not possible to say when burials commenced ; but from an inscription 
of 1825 it is clear that both cemeteries were used simultaneously. Seven 
inscriptions only are left, two of which are after the Mutiny. 

1. " In memory of John Coulson Pyle. Born 17th December 
1807. Died 14th March 1846." 

2. " Sacred to the memory of Frederick Pyle, son of John 
Coulson and Margaret Pyle. Born 16th November 1840. Died 25th 
June 1842." 

3. " In memory of Margaret, wife of J. C. Pyle, who departed 
this life at Furukabad on the 8th October 1843, aged 29 years 11 
months and 8 days. 11 

J. C. Pyle is mentioned in the records from 1830 onwards. 
He was at first a manufacturer of crude saltpetre, being agent 
for the then Civil Surgeon, Doctor Jeffreys, who was carrying on 
this business as a profitable side line. He lived in the Circular 
Road, the factory itself being in Naukhanda village, near the 
District Jail. In 1840 he became manager of the mineral waters 
factory of Kanhaya Lai in the Circular Road. 

The Fatehgarh soda water factory merits special notice, 
tip to 1830, soda water was imported from Europe, and was 
expensive ; and since beer was mostly drunk during the decade 
from 1820, there was no great demand for it. Brandy then 
supplanted beer, and after 1830 soda water was in greater 
request, In 1835, a large concern was started in Fatehgarh 
Town, and Pyle became its manager. Fatehgarh then supplied 
the whole country around. 



119 

Memoirs written in the thirties make mention of the 
Fatehgarh sodas. In 1932 in the course of brick-making opera- 
tions on the site of Pyle's old premises, large quantities of old 
fashioned soda water bottles were unearthed. Beyond being 
recorded as the inventor of a complicated water pump for the, 
use of the Jail, Pyle disappears from view after 1840. 

4. " Sacred to the memory of Coir. Sergeant J, Clements, 
H. ATS. 80th Regt., who departed this life on the 28th April A. D. 
1858, aged 56 years 8 months, leaving a wife and 6 children to 
deplore his irreparable loss. Deeply regretted by all who knew him. 
This tomb was erected by Paymaster W. Brown, 80th Regt. 

The 80th Regt, is now the 2nd Bu., The South Stafford- 
shire Regiment. A wing of this regiment only arrived in 
Fatehgarh on the 25th April, three days before Clements died, 
having escorted the Commander-in-Chiefs camp from Cawnpore. 
It took over guard of the Fort from the 82nd Foot. 

5. " Sacred to the memory of Alfred and Charles Alfred, infant 
sons of Henry and Maria Babonau, who departed this life on the 
22nd December 1825 and on the 27th September 1827, aged one 
year six months ten days, and one year one month and sixteen days. ' 

Henry Babonau, 1765-1834, was an assistant commissary of 
Ordnance, 1818. Deputy Commissary in 1823, when he came 
to Fatehgarh. He was a warrant officer, and had been given a 
commission as local cornet in the 2nd (Borlases) Rampura 
Local Cavalry in 1818, but reverted to his warrant officer's rank. 
In 1829 he signed a memorial to Government, prepared by the 
civilian inhabitants of Cantonments. He died iu Calcutta in 
1834. Buried in the Bhawanipore cemetery at Calcutta. 

6. " Sacred to the memory of Wilfrid Hine, born 25th April 
1789 in the county of Cumberland, England, died at Futtyghur 4th 
Feby. 1855, aged 65 years 9 months 10 days, leaving six sorrowing 
sons and a large circle of relations and friends." 

Hine was an invalid warrant officer, who made his home at 
Fatehgarh. He was originally a conductor in the Ordnance, and 



120 

figures in the annual registers from 1832 both as a pensioner 
and a merchant. In 1842 he was superintendent of the road- 
making operations at Gursahaiganj ; but his accounts being found 
in disorder by the Road Committee he was dismissed. The 
family lived in the Circular Road, and later on the site of the 
Gracey Club in the Company Garden. Two of the sons escaped 
in the Mutiny. They were then working as Head Clerk and 
Judicial Clerk respectively in the Collector's office, and made 
their way to friendly villages. One of them, W. Hine, was 
living in 1880. See " Fatehgarh and the Mutiny" for the 
account of their escape. 

7. "In memory of Thomas Emmanuel, son of Adam and Emma 

Anthony. Born at Allahabad 9th Novr. 1859 and after a few days 

full of trouble mercifully gathered by the Good Shepherd into the fold 

above on the 26th July 1861." 

There are a few tombs of interest in the District outside Fatehgarh. 

1. A brick tomb at Chhibramau by a deserted indigo factory. 
Nothing has been discovered as to the identity of the person buried 

in it. 

2. At Mehndi Ghat on the Ganges, near Kanauj, in the Idgah 
enclosure, and close to the old indigo factory are three tombs. The 
following is the only legible inscription left. " Sacred to the memory 
of Matilda, beloved wife of Edward John Chandler, aged 20 years, 
',1 months and 17 days, died 80th August 1855." 

This lady was connected with the family of a military 
pensioner, named Sergeant-Major Chandler, who lived in No. 14 
Bungalow at Fatehgarh. Her husband must have been an assis- 
tant in the Maxwell, or Packard factory, close by. 
!i. On a hill overlooking the spot where the Kali Nadi used to 
How into the Ganges, and two miles east of Serai Miran, is a tall 
pyramid with the remains of armorial bearings on its sides. A few 
feet to the east of this pyramid is a massive tomb with rounded top, 
and some distance to the rear of it is a small tomb, which is al- 
most flat with the ground. These are the tombs of an officer, his 



121 

horse and dog, drowned when crossing the Kali Nadi in flood. In 
September 1885 Mrs. Fanny Parks visited this tomb on her way by 
boat to Fatehgarh, and in her book " The Wanderings of a Pilgrim " 
she describes the officer as a colonel, although she does not give his 
name. The pyramid was always whitewashed in those days to serve 
as a navigation mark for boats sailing on the Ganges. 

The tomb appears to be that of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas 
Wharton, who commanded the 5th N. C. He raised this regi- 
ment at Ghazipur in 1800. He was drowned in the Kali Nadi on 
the 21st January 1802. At the battle of Bitaurah in 1794 he 
was second in command to his brother-in-law, Richard Ramsay, 
both having married (laughters of Samuel Skardon. (See notice 
of Samuel Skardon's epitaph in the Fort cemetery). 
4. " Sacred to the memory of Lieutenant-Colonel John Guthrie 
of Kilmarnock in Scotland, n Peer of the Mogul Empire. He was 
born the 6th of March 1749, and departed this life on the 18th 
October, in consequence of a wound received at the assault on the 
Fort of Tateeah, 30th September 1803." 

The tomb is a square block of brickwork, situated in a grove 
in sight of the high mound, on which the old fort of Thatia 
formerly stood. The Raja of Thatia in Pargana Tirwa refused 
to recognise the cession of the District in 1802, and took up arms. 
Guthrie commanded the column which reduced the Fort. He 
was a cadet in 1771 at the age of 22 years, and, if this date is 
correct, he was a rather elderly cadet for those days. He served 
through the operations in the Doab in 1776, and the battle of 
Koran. He was a captain in the 33rd Bn. of Sepoys in 1787. 
He raised the 1/1 6th N. I . , a regiment which took his name, and 
afterwards became the 3rd Brahmans. This battalion, " Guthrie- 
ki-paltan ", was present in the action at Thatia. Guthrie was hit 
by a spent ball, and apparently died from lack of proper medical 
attention. His tomb is whitewashed annually at the expense of 
Government. 



CHAPTER VI. 

KASIM BAGH, THE OLD JAIL, AND BARHPUR. 



ALF a mile south-west of the Fort is Kasim Bagh and its old ceme- 
« tery, now hidden behind the Regimental Lines. The remains of 

the ruined tomb of Kasim Bangash still remain, and it is from this tomb 
that the name of the area is derived. Kasim was the father-in-law of 
Nawab Mohammad Khan, the Bangash founder of the City. Kasim was 
killed on this spot by Hindoo robbers of the Bam tela tribe; and it was 
his murder, which served as a pretext for Nawab Mohammad Khan to seize 
the Bamtela lands, and build the City upon them. 

Kasim Bagh is an area to the west of the cemetery, at present con- 
taining a small dilapidated bungalow, which forty years ago served as an 
Indian Infantry hospital, the remnants of some old Indian Infantry lines, 
and the railway workshops. Prior to the Mutiny, Kasim Bagh was out- 
side the Cantonment, and consisted of a grove surrounded by a wall, and 
a compound with house, warehouses, and other appurtenances. This 
compact property was styled Kasim Bagh, and the first owner was Mr. 
James Donnithorne, Collector of the District, 1808 to 1817, who grew 
strawberries and peaches on it. It then passed into the hands of another 
Civilian, Mr. Henry Swetenham, who in 1823, sold the whole property 
for Rs. 1,500, to James Mercer. Kasim Bagh deteriorated in value ; and 
it does not appear to have been desirable for business purposes. After a 
year or two Mr. Mercer, himself a trader amongst other occupations, 
transferred the whole area to Messrs. Mackintosh and Co., merchants of 
Calcutta, who in their turn let it go for Rs. 500 in 1828 to Mr. James 
Carshore. Mr. Carshore was not long owner; for in less than 3 months 
he passed on his title to one Babil Gur Mohan for the same sum. Kasim 
BagVs last appearance in the records was in 1847, when it figured as 
security for a loan, and the transaction was registered by its erstwhile 
owner, Mr. James Mercer. The grove and its wall has gone. The tomb 
has nearly gone, and save for an insignificant thatched bungalow and a 
hamlet near the railway, there are no signs of this property to be seen. 



128 

The old Indian Infantry Lines belong to post -Mutiny times, and 
were the home usually of two companies from Agra. A short metalled 
road, which led to the Quarter Guard, can still be seen on the north side 
of the Qadri Gate Road, before reaching the railway boundary. The 
Qadri Gate Road was planted with 1,000 trees by Mr. Middleton (Magis- 
trate 1826-29), and in 1834, Mr. Shore, the Magistrate, planted 494 
more up to the Qadri Gate. 

Kasim Bagh also covers the area of the Railway Engine Shed and 
workshops, which date from after 1880. For many years the district 
administration was carried on here. It cannot be said where the first 
courts were set up; but in October 1807, Government bought two bunga- 
lows for Rs. 9,000, both of which were already very old; and as subse- 
quent transactions show, they were grossly overvalued. In January 1810 
one of them became unfit for use, and was bought at the sale for Rs. 700 
by the then Collector, Mr. Donnithorne. This gentleman was exceedingly 
astute ; for it was his intention to acquire a property, on which he could 
reside in this locality. He built himself a house, which has been described 
as a very fine one by the Marquis of Hastings, who stayed in it. The 
remaining bungalow, which continued to be used as the district offices, 
was 30 yards away. Mr. Donnithorne had it condemned in 1814, and its 
sale was sanctioned. Mr. Donnithorne was naturally the purchaser at the 
moderate price of Rs. 600. Government was suspicious ; but the Collector 
graphically describing the horrors of the old building, convinced the 
authorities that it was the ground he wanted and not the worthless building. 
His reports indicate the extreme discomfort in which officials worked 
in those early days. This old court house, he says, had only brick 
walls up to the top of the doors. Above that level the walls were mud, the 
whole surmounted by thatch. The largest room was 22 feet square, and 
300 persons daily tried to get into it. The treasury work was carried on 
in a verandah room 22 by 10 feet. The district records and English 
letter books were kept in two recesses in the wall. It was only in 1814, 
after the building had besn sold, that Government allowed the Collector 
to buy two cupboards at Rs. 50 each. The district courts were then moved 
to the Mint building (see chap. VII), and functioned there up to 1829. 



124 

The result of Mr. Donnithorne's exertions was a square property 
with a residence, extending from the main road in a northerly direction. 
The centre of it is now occupied by railway workshops. He resided here 
for most of his long term of thirteen years' office as Collector, and formed 
a habitation, which was the object of much admiration to the rest of the 
Station. The compound was entered through a large gate house. At the 
end of the drive was the mansion itself, described as very extensive and 
convenient. The garden around the house was laid out with shrubs and 
lawns. In front of it was a square tank, filled with " red and green " 
fish, and with a fountain in the middle. A well, with Persian wheel 
attached, was another of the curiosities of the garden. The Marquis of 
Hastings was well content with this country house, which became the 
scene of many princely entertainments. Mr. Donnithorne, too, peacefully 
living out his old age at St. Agnes in Cornwall, must often have recalled 
this spot to his memory, a home of which not a vestige of its former 
magnificence now remains above ground. He left in 1822, and four years 
later the property was sold to Mr. Middleton, the Judge. On his transfer 
in 1829, the house passed to Sah Behari Lai, by whose name it was known 
up to the coming of the Railway. When Mr. Middleton left Fatehgarh 
in 1829, and sold the house to Sah Behari Lai, the Collector (Mr. Nisbet) 
took the house on a monthly rent of Rs. 150 to contain the District offices, 
which thus returned from the Mint to the site of their old abode. On Mr. 
Nisbet's departure from the District, the Collector's office migrated a 
second time to the Mint for about three years. In 1883 it became a 
cholera hospital during the severe epidemic in September of that year. 
From 1834 to 1838 it became for the last time the seat of the District 
Courts, and then a private residence. In 1849 the officiating Collector, 
Mr. Thompson, was living in it. It was described as a large, square, and 
well built house. It lasted down to 1880. 

By proceeding in the direction of the City through the railway 
quarter, the site of the old Jail at Lakhula Bagh will be reached. 
Lakhula Bagh itself is not without a history of vivid interest. The word 
" Lakhula " is derived from " lakh," one hundred thousand, arid " wara," a 
plantation. The place was known alternatively as " Lakhpera ", the grove 



125 

of a hundred thousand trees. Kaim Khan, the second Bangash Nawab, 
planted it, as it was near to his fort at New Amethi, where he lived before 
succeeding his father, Nawab Mohamed Khan, in 1743. The plantation 
then covered 158 acres, and formed a park of regal proportions, within 
the boundaries of which the camps of distinguished visitors were always 
laid out. In 1771 the Emperor Shah Alam set up the imperial head- 
quarters here, and he was the first of many high dignitaries to honour the 
grove with his residence. It was the headquarters also of the infamous 
"Dooby-ki-paltan" in 1857, which pitched its tents in the only remaining 
portion of the old park, then called the " Bhirra Bagh ". 

A letter, dated the 19th June 1815, gives an interesting account of 
the visit of the son of the Nawab Vizier of Oudh, who came in that month 
to compliment the Governor-General, then staying in Mr. Donnithorne's 
house, upon the success of the Nepal War. The visitor was accompanied by 
a suite of 15,000 persons, and this small army stayed nearly a fortnight! 
Accomodation for the visitors was made in the Lakhula Park in 
accordance with custom. On the 15th June the young Prince went to break- 
fast with the Marquis of Hastings, or Lord Moira, as he was then more 
generally called. Mr. Deane (a Commissioner for the Ceded Provinces) and 
Mr. Donnithorne sent a quantity of peaches from their gardens, which were 
presented to the visitor. On the 17th the Governor-General returned the 
visit, and two days later the Prince and his chief attendants went to dinner 
with him. The Marquis wrote in his journal that " such a ceremony is 
an oppressive service at this season ; but as there was much cordiality, it 
went off well ". A letter from Fatehgarh contains the following descrip- 
tion of these festivities: 

" We have had very splendid doings here lately. The present 
Nawab Vizier's son, Nuziroodeen Hyder, a boy of about ten years 
of age and nominally Prime Minister, .has come over with a retinue of 
15,000 men and all the magnificent accompaniments of an Eastern 
court to visit Lord Moira. He entered Futtyghur on the 14th and 
pitched his camp near Lac Para, a garden belonging to the Nawab 
of Furruckabad, about IV2 miles from cantonments. He breakfasted 
with his Lordship, all the station being invited. Mr. Swinton, the 



126 

Persian Secretary, and Capt. Huthwaite, the Persian Interpreter, 
[Ksrformed the ceremony of meeting him one Stage from this, and 
accompanied him to his camp. The same gentlemen proceeded to 
the camp on the 15th, and attended the honorary procession to the 
Government Bungalow. The Nawabcame in great state, accompanied 
by Mr. Baillie, brother of Major Baillie, and Assistant to the Re- 
sidency, and Aga Meer, the present Dew an, and was received by his 
Lordship with marked attention. After partaking of breakfast, 
which was laid for sixty, the Nawab returned home, and Aga Meer 
remained to transact business with Lord Moira. 

On the Kith the whole station having been invited to accompany 
the Governor-General, his Lordship proceeded in State to return the 
Nuwab's visit. The retinue was exceedingly magnificent. First, the 
camel corps, 200 strong, preceded by two jinjals (swivel guns) ; 
second, a party of the bodyguard ; third, a party of irregulars ; fourth, 
a body of spearsmen with flags ; fifth, the Governor-General's carriage 
with four horses ; sixth, the Governor-General's led horses, sumptuous- 
ly caparisoned ; seventh, peons; eighth, Lord Moiva, his personal staff, 
secretaries and gentlemen of the station, on elephants which were 
finely decorated with jhools. Mr. Baillie and the Dewan were also 
on elephants. 'They had come to attend his Lordship early in the 
morning. They were followed by another party of the bodyguard, 
in all WO and about 150 of the Nuwab's irregular horse. 

The morning was delightfully cool, a north-wester having fortu- 
nately come on during the night, and the cavalcade as it moved through 
the town along the circuitous road leading to the Nawab's encampment 
had a most beautiful and picturesque effect (the Nuwab's camp was 
in the eastern portion of the Lakhula Bagh and on the Amethi Road. 
Hence the Governor-General had to proceed down the Qadri Gate 
Road to the City and then turn round into the Amethi Road). When 
about hallway we first discovered the camp which is situated in a thick 
grove of trees; and being composed of various coloured materials, it 
sparkled with great brilliancy. For a considerable distance before 
we reached the encampment the road was lined by irregular horse, 



127 

and followers of the Nuwab on horseback ; the Nmvah's troops drawn 
out in Hue; his camel corps dressed iu yellow and red ; his bodyguard, 
and last of all his escort commanded by au European officer. The bands 
of each corps struck up as we passed them. A Unit S£00 yards from 
the encampment the Nuwab, attended by several persons of distinction 
on elephants, met Lord Moira, and exchanged salutations with his 
Lordship. On his Lordship's arrival a salute of cannon was fired. The 
Nuwab taking Lord Moira's hand led him, followed by all his suite, 
into a spacious tent, spread with white cloth, and all the gentlemen 
were introduced to him by Lord Moira. The party were then shown 
into the breakfast apartment, which was under a large canopy, where 
they sat down to a long table covered with every kind of delicacy and 
refreshment, the Nuwab's band playing a variety of English airs with 
considerable taste and skill. During breakfast a troop of nautch 
girls were introduced, who danced and sang; then tumblers, and 
finally a theatrical representation. 

When breakfast was finished the Nuwab led his Lordship and 
suite into an apartment formed of canauts (canvas screens) and a 
semiana (canopy), spread with white carpets, where a variety of trays 
were displayed, containing shawls, and gold and silver tissue. At 
one end of the apartment was a transparency, representing the portrait 
of Lord Moira, an excellent likeness copied from Mr. Home's admir- 
able picture at Lucknow. The frame was covered with rich cut glass 
double branch shades by which it was lighted at night. On each side 
of the picture was a coach, splendidly adorned. The presentation of 
nugirs (ceremonial presents) followed, after which his Lordship and 
suite departed with the same ceremony and honours as were observed 
on his arrival. 

Lord Moira has presented the Nuwab with his beautiful grey 
English horse, decorated with costly accoutrements in the Hindostanee 
fashion. This valuable horse is well known in Calcutta, and has with 
another horse of equal beauty, a chestnut, been much admired for 
strength and fine carriage. They belonged to the Prince Regent, who 
gave them to Lord Moira on his leaving England. The Nuwab 



128 

expressed great delight in receiving so valuable a present. His 
Highness and suite dine with Lord Moira this evening, and the whole 
station have been invited to meet him. To-morrow the Nuwab returns 
the honour. It is supposed that he will leave Futtyghur on the first 
of next month. 

We have the liveliest pleasure in stating that Lady Loudoun

It was opposite to the enclosure of the Lakhula Park, on the southern 

side of the (*)adri Gate Road, that Mr. Ahmuty, the second District 

Magistrate, selected a site for the District Jail, and Mr. Cockburn, the 

first Collector, acquired the land for him. The acquisition papers are still 

preserved, and constitute one of the oldest existing files of the Collector's 

office. In the " Fatehgarh-nama " there is also a very complete plan of the 

Jail, showing the interior arrangements ; and for the fifty-one years of its 

existence on this spot records are available in such quantities that it would 

be possible to compile an account in minute detail. More, in fact, is known 

about the old Jail than about any other Government institution of pre- 

Mutiny times. In addition, the " Fntehgarh-nama " devotes many pages 

to the biographies of celebrated criminals, who were interned in it. This 

Jail was not the first one. A Jail was set up by Mr. Grant, the first 

District Magistrate, in 180fJ somewhere in the City. The institution of a 

Jail was the very first measure of the new administration ; for the Bnngash 

Nawabs handed over their territory in a state of turmoil. Viscount 

Valentia, who stayed with Mr. Grant in 180ft, noted that he had seventy 

murderers in Jail awaiting trial. Mr. Grant died in 1804 before the Jail 

was properly completed, and in that very year, when Holkar made his raid 

on the City, the prisoners were able to break jail with ease. A reward of 

Rs. 25 was offered for the capture of each. One prisoner, who was under 

trial for murder, was taken twelve years later, and the reward for him 



120 

was paid in 1817. Hardly had the Jail started than Government decided 
on a new one at Lakhula Bagh, which was nearer to the Courts at Kasim 
Bagh. In 1806 it was built at a cost of Rs. 20,000, and Rs. 13,000 more 
had to be sanctioned in 1816 for its extension. From that date up to the 
Mutiny the buildings remained unchanged with one notable exception of 
a mill house, over which much official correspondence was created. 

The internal arrangements were very much as they are in a modern 
Jail, and were never varied. In 1856 the hospital was located temporarily 
in the Commissariat Godown behind Colonelganj, but the distance was too 
far, and tbe hospital on the premises was enlarged. For over thirty years 
the prisoners were fed by contract, the diet allowance being nine pies per 
diem for each up to 1830, in which year the allowance was raised to one 
anna, grain having become dear. In 1838 the system of rations was 
introduced in place of the daily allowance of money. 

The exact site of the Jail can be traced. It was situated on the 
southern side of the road to the City and a few yards beyond the first 
furlong, after the first mile stone. The eastern end of the Jail was on a 
level with a small mosque, which still is to be seen by the road side, nearly 
opposite the third furlong. The famous mill house was where the brick 
kilns now stand ; and it is interesting to note that this very plot, number 
200 in Masaini village, is called by the villagers today the " Chakki 
khana," or mill house. This is an example of the exactness of tradition 
in Indian villages, and a memorial of the Hon. F. J. Shore, who when 
serving as Magistrate in 1832 was responsible for initiating this form of 
jail labour. He decided to instal a treadmill. The idea was to make the 
convicts grind com instead of loafing outside the Jail, picking at the roads, 
or cleaning ditches, which were their normal occupations. He built a 
mill house outside the western wall of the Jail. A long shaft passed from 
the mill house through the Jail wall into the interior, where the convicts 
made it revolve. This project cost Government Rs. 1,087. The treadmill not 
only failed to work ; but it became the chief object of interest in the Station 
and the official bugbear of successive District Officers. For nearly five 
years the Government, the District Magistrate, and Mr. Shore at Dehra 
Dun carried on a voluminous correspondence over its eccentricities. Captain 



130 

Boileau tinkered at it occasionally, when the work of making roads at Gur- 
sahaiganj permitted; while Lieutenant Showers of the 14th N. I. amused 
himself in 1839 with its plans and estimates. The truth is that Mr. Shore 
had miscalculated, as he admitted from his retreat in Dehra Dun, and he 
suggested to the harassed Government the insertion of an additional inter- 
mediate wheel, the cost of which he offered to pay out of his own pocket. 

The Jail was divided into eight wards, each holding sixty convicts. 
It was nearly always overcrowded, when the convicts had no work outside. 
In 1834 the Jail population was 1,132, and in the year before the monthly 
average was 1,100. The casualties in 1833 were exceptionally heavy, 
nineteen deaths being reported for the first six months alone. In 1835 the 
numbers fell to 495. A jail return in this year shows that 107 convicts 
only were actually in the wards, the remainder being employed on the 
Cawnpore Road ; 21 of the inmates were in hospital; 18 in the female 
ward ; 66 undergoing simple imprisonment; and 2 suffering imprisonment 
for life in solitary confinement cells. Desperate characters, like dacoits 
and thugs, were sent by river to the Alipore Jail at Calcutta, and fifty per 
cent, of them escaped on the way. A return of 1846 contains the names 
of one jailor and two assistant jailors as superior staff. Subordinate to 
them was a tumandar, or commander (over 8 duffedars and 90 burkandazes), 
2 drawers of water, 3 sweepers, 1 blacksmith for rivetting fetters, 
1 executioner, and 2 doctors. There were extra burkandazes, or guards, 
for gangs on labour outside the Jail. 

The convicts were employed on public works. They pulled the 
punkha in the district courts and hospitals in the hot weather. They 
worked under Lieutenant Weller in making the Grand Trunk Road ; 
under Captain Boileau at Khudaganj ; under Captain Lumsden in trans- 
porting kankar stone; and on the roads in the City and Cantonments. 
Each gang of five was watched by one burkandaz ; and in 1829 the muster 
rolls show that 596 convicts were at work, under the guard of 119 
burkandazes. It was easy to requisition a gang for use in Cantonments, 
and constant squabbles took place between officials, who wanted their 
services. In 1834 Captain Boileau, the road maker, bitterly complained 
of the Gun Carriage Agent, Major Fulton, who had purloined his gangs, 



131 

and made them work inside the Fort. The records indicate that the work 
of the convicts was bad. They pretended to mend roads, and clean 
drains. They had much liberty in the day, and were only locked up at 
night. Their friends were able to see them, pass them sweets and tobacco, 
and converse with them by the connivance of the guards. Convict labour 
soon fell into disfavour, and it was complained they often did more harm 
than good. In 1831 Mrs. Potter wrote to the District Magistrate, and 
said the convicts had ruined the drains around her house (south of No. 14). 
The Magistrate sent back a detachment to put them right again. 

The old Jail disappeared in the Mutiny, not before witnessing a 
dramatic scene. On the 7th June 1857 the prisoners shook off discipline, 
having appointed several of their number as generals and colonels. 
Captain Vibart arrived to quell the riot, and was driven off by a volley of 
stones. A company of the 10th N. I . , which eleven days later itself 
broke into mutiny, was ordered down to the Jail, and made short work of 
the rioters by killing seven, including the chief general, and wounding 
eight more. On the 18th following, the sepoys opening the jail doors, 
released the inmates, and destroyed the buildings. 

A cross road from near the site of the old Jail leads to the Lid Gate 
Road and to Barhpur. The Mission station at Barhpur was founded by 
the American Presbyterian Mission, probably about a year after the 
Rakha settlement. The date and circumstances of the founding of the 
Mission here are obscure, and the question is discussed in chapter X 1 1 in 
the account of Rakha. About 1841 Mr. Rankin seems to have placed 
the establishment on a sound footing. The district records indicate the 
existence of a chapel and two bungalows to the west of the road. The 
educational side of the Mission's activities were best known. The Boys' 
High School (mentioned in 1839), was developed in 1845, when it took 
the place of the Government institution in Farrukhabad, and occupied 
the same premises, which in turn were handed over to the present Mission 
Girls' School. Barhpur, like Rakha, was destroyed in the Mutiny, and 
many of the Indian workers driven away. The Headmaster of the School, 
Dhaukal Pershad, was with his family murdered in the parade ground 
massacre. The two missionaries in charge, Messrs. A. O. Johnson and 



182 

D. E. Campbell, took refuge with their families at Rakha. They escaped 
in the boats to Cawnpore, and were killed in the massacre of the 
Fatehgarh residents on the 12th June. Miss Mary Johnson and Miss 
Rachel Mitchell, relations of the Revd. A. O. Johnson, still maintain the 
family connection with local branches of the Mission. On the eastern 
side of the road is the Memorial Hospital of the Mission under the 
direction of Doctor Adelaide Woodard and Miss S. L. McRobbie. The 
name of the Hospital perpetuates the memory of the sacrifices of the 
Fatehgarh Mission during the Mutiny, a full account of which will be 
found in a book by the Revd. J. J. Walsh, called " A Memorial of 
Fatehgarh," and in " Fatehgarh and the Mutiny." 

Satanpur village, opposite the cemetery of the Mission, formed occa- 
sion for some of the reminiscences of Mrs. Fanny Parks. In her 
" Wanderings of a Pilgrim" Mrs. Parks recounts that she came to 
Fatehgarh on the (jth April 1835 to stay a month with Mr. Henry 
Swetenham, the Judge, who was a relation of hers. She came to Satanpur 
to visit a Mahratta princess, styled H. H. the Baiza Bai, who had been 
exiled from Gwalior, and allowed by the Government to take up her 
residence in an old indigo factory. The account of the Baiza Bai's 
surroundings is good reading. It is only sufficient to say here that the 
house was surrounded by a wall of some extent, and that two tame 
rhinoceroses were to be seen galloping about the grounds. The Baiza Bai 
being a high personage was supervised by a political officer named Captain 
Ross, who lived in a camp close by. She had arrived with a small army 
in February of the year before ; and the residents of Fatehgarh were not 
unnaturally apprehensive. The Government commanded the Magistrate 
to adopt " such precautions as the residence of a large body of men in the 
neighbourhood may render necessary." This was easier said than done, 
for the 1st N. I. in Cantonments was greatly under strength. 

Mrs. Parks had barely left, when 500 of the Baiza Bai's troops broke 
into open mutiny, and with 4 guns went to Captain Ross's camp. The 
non-payment of arrears and the appointment of an unpopular command- 
ant by the Baiza Bai were the chief causes. The confidential reports of 
the Commissioner show that a contributory cause was disaffection, stirred 



133 

up by secret agents from Gwalior. A large body of troops, however, 
remained staunch at the indigo factory, and were ordered to attack the 
mutineers. There was a good fusillade, mainly of blank cartridges. One 
man was killed and two wounded. Some arrears of pay were doled out 
by the Baiza Bai, and with the unpopular commander flying for his life 
to Gwalior, the incident closed for the time being. 

The Commissioner, Mr. Boulderson, was fully alive to the danger. 
The Magistrate, Mr. F. R. Robinson, submitted an almost daily bulletin, 
founded on reports by spies. At the beginning of September the undis- 
ciplined soldiery of the Baiza Bai began to show renewed discontent. 
They claimed seven months' arrears of pay, while the Baiza Bai would 
only admit 3£ months ; but the truth is that the Mahrattas were heartily 
sick of their surroundings. At this juncture Mrs. Parks makes her 
second arrival in Fatehgarh, and is advised by Mr. Swetenham not to go 
to Barhpur. The Baiza Bai had 2,360 armed retainers, of whom 900 
were horsemen, 4 guns, and over 5,000 camp followers. This little army 
was quartered in lines by the road, and one of the camp wells is still 
pointed out in Satanpur. In Fatehgarh the 1st N. I. had a full strength 
of only 460. Deducting guards, sick, and those wanted for necessary 
duties, the regiment could only muster 200 men. The Officer Command- 
ing, Lieutenant-Colonel Tulloch (1790-1862), therefore, requisitioned 
two guns from the Fort under Lieutenant Ellis, R. A. (died at Fatehgarh 
14th December 1835). 

At 5 p. m. on the 8th September the Baiza Bibi sent word to Mr. 
Swetenham that her men were out of control, and had arrested five of 
her agents. Colonel Tulloch with his troops, Lieutenant Ellis and the 
two guns from the Fort, accompanied by Mr. Robinson (died 1856) and 
Mr. Rose, his joint Magistrate, reached the Satanpur Lines after dark. 
The Baiza Bai's four guns were secured, and most of the night parleys 
went on with the mutineers. At daybreak they still refused to give up their 
prisoners, or lay down their arms. Colonel Tulloch ordered a bayonet 
charge, which was successful. The mutineers threw down their arms after 
a slight resistance, being hastened by a discharge of grape from Lieu- 
tenant Ellis' guns. Six mutineers were killed and twelve wounded ; but 



134 

two of the Baiza Bai's agents had been murdered. Seven sepoys were 
wounded, and Mr. Robinson in addition. The latter had indeed a 
marvellous escape. On two mutineers threatening him with daggers, Jte 
closed, and grasped them both by the throat. While pushing them back- 
wards, Mr. Robinson fell into a well, and the others fell on top of him. 
A desperate fight ensued at the bottom, and Mr. Robinson was stajbbed, 
before the sepoys came and bayonetted his assailants. These riots decid- 
ded Government. The 71st N. I. and a squadron of the 5th Cavalry were 
sent from Cawnpore under Colonel Dick, and troops from Maippuri in 
addition. The Baiza Bai's establishment was broken up, and she was 
deported to Benares via Cawnpore and Allahabad, at both of wfyich places 
Mrs. Parks visited her again. 

It is possible to trace the foundations of the house, in which Mrs. 
Parks visited the Baiza Bai, and tried her Arab's paces in the compound. 
There are still plots in Mauza Satanpur known as the " Bai ki kothtwalla 
khet " ; and an ancient well of large dimensions is on the site. Proceeding 
towards the City, and after the Mission bungalows, the visitor will turn 
off the main road by the house of Babu Gendan Lai, and proceed along 
a foot path, until the railway line is crossed. To the east and parallel to 
the railway line are thirteen plots. Number 12 contains the well. To the 
west of the well is the site of the house, which with its garden lay between 
the well and the point were the footpath crosses the railway. The footpath 
leads one and a half miles across the main road to the Tonka Ghat on the 
Ganges. It was at this place that Mrs. Parks moored her pinnace for the 
inspection of the Baiza Bai. She recorded the impression made on her by 
the temples and high cliffs over the ghat, crowded with gaily dressed 
Mahratta horsemen and attendants. 



CHAPTER VII. 

THE CANTONMENTS. 



THE oldest maps available indicate that up to the Mutiny the 
Cantonment was a small area, which only included the officers 1 houses 
and the Lines of the infantry. In the eighteenth century there had 
been no necessity to demarcate any cantonment, since the whole of 
Fatehgarh, town included, was under military control, and the Civil 
Lines did not exist at ail. When the garrison declined in 1805, the 
area known as Cantonments came into being to distinguish the exclusively 
military area from that which was devoted to the civil administration. 
For some reason the boundaries did not include the Fort. The present 
Maude Lines, the Park where now is the Officers' Mess and No. 4 
Bungalow, and half of Colonelganj were outside. The other half of 
Colonelganj, the present Quarter Guard, and War Memorial were only 
just inside. The boundaries were illogical and awkward. Accordingly, 
Sir Colin Campbell had them changed in 1858, and they were made to 
run as they do today. 

The houses have decreased in number from the seventy of 1829 to 
eighteen. They were numbered one to twenty in 1880, and they still 
preserve their numbers, although Nos. 1 and 3 have disappeared 
within the last ten years. With the exception of the Indian Military 
Hospital, which is not numbered as a residence, there are no houses at 
present which escaped destruction in the Mutiny. The mutineers 
extracted beams and doorposts for firewood, and during the five months 
of the mutineers' rule, the mud walls and thatch of each house crumbled 
to ruin. In 1859 the Collector served notices on the old house owners 
to repair them. In cases of default a committee, formed by the Judge 
and two others, valued the ruins, and had them sold by auction. The 
old house lists of the Cantonment office have disappeared ; and reliance 
has had to be made on the laconic entries in the settlement registers of 
1833, or on a few sale deeds in the Registrar's office, in order to gain a 
little information about them. 



186 
The Mint. 

The house north-west of the Indian Military Hospital is generally 
known as the " Tarwalla Bungla ", having been the headquarters of the 
Superintendent of Telegraphs and Post Offices after 1860. Since it 
occupies the site of the famous Farrukhabad Mint, the house is called 
" Dar-ul-Zarb " in the records, and " Taksal ", another word for mint, 
even at the present day. 

Kanauj, once the capital of northern India, had a mint for copper 
coinage in the sixteenth century. It has been suggested that the 
Bangash Nawabs abolished it, when they decided to set up their mint 
for silver coins. At any rate, shortly after 1714 Nawab Mohamed Khan, 
the founder of the City, established a mint in the small village of 
Husainpur in front of the Fort at Fatehgarh. The first coins issued were 
in the name of the Emperor Farrukhsiyar, after whom this district is 
named. This mint reached its highest development during the reign of 
the third Bangash Nawab, Ahmad Khan, who died in 1771 and was 
buried in the Bihisht Bagh, or Garden of Paradise, by the Mau Gate of 
the City. From him comes the name Ahmadnagar, which appears on 
the coins along with the name Farrukhabad, and these coins are commonly 
to be obtained in the local bazars even today. The name Ahmadnagar 
is usually understood to be the name of a place, and its conjunction with 
that of Farrukhabad has led to confusion. Coins bearing this name, 
however, are the issues of Nawab Ahmad Khan, and were struck from 
the reign of the Emperor Alamgir II onwards. Ahmad Khan had such 
fondness for new coins, that it is related he used to have every issue 
spread out on the ground in the open air before him. His servants 
astutely took advantage of this mania of his, and covering the soles 
of their feet with wax, were wont to walk over the rupees again, and 
again, and in this manner steal not a few of them. When the Nawab 
saw fewer bags of rupees left than had come to him from the Mint, he 
remarked that they must have shrunk from exposure to the sun ! 

The Bangash mint continued to function in Husainpur after the 
setting up of Fatehgarh Cantonment. Between 1777 and 1805, when 



137 

Fatehgarh became one of the mint towns of the East India Company 
under the name of Farrukhabad, the coins conformed to the prevailing 
type of the Emperor Shah Alam coinage, but with this difference that 
the regnal year of the Emperor was occasionally changed. Between 1788 
and 1796 the coins indicated the year fil of the Emperor's reign on the 
reverse side, irrespective of khe Mohamedan date. After 1796 the coins 
show the year 39 of ths Emperor's reign, and from 1803 onwards 
the familiar year 45 appears, which is most generally to be seen on all 
coins procurable today. 

In 1802 the management of the Mint passed to the East India 
Company, which continued up to 1824 to coin rupees with the name of 
the Emperor, Shah Alam, at Fatehgarh, and up to 1835 at Calcutta. 
Regulation XLV of 1803 contained the following order: 

'• A silver coin to be denominated the Lucknow sicca rupee of 
the 45th sun (year), struck in the mint of Farrukhabad, correspond- 
ing in weight and standard with the sicca rupee at present struck 
at Lucknow in the dominions of the Nawab Vizier, and thence 
denominated the Lucknow rupee, is hereby declared to be the 
established and legal silver coin in the provinces ceded by the Nawab 
Vizier to the East India Company." 
The same Regulation XLV directed the establishment of a mint at 
or in the vicinity of the town of Farrukhabad. Half and quarter rupees 
were also to be coined. The Lucknow 45th sun sicca rupee, as established 
by this regulation, was to be exactly like the 19th sun sicca rupee, in the 
Mint at Calcutta. The term "sicca rupee", which occurs constantly in 
the records along with that of " sonat rupees " requires some explanation 
In the eighteenth century there was an amazing variety of coinages in 
India, called after the various mints, which produced them. On the 19th 
April 1794 the Governor-General in Council issued regulations for the 
conduct of the mints. Only the 19th sun rupee was to be received at the 
Public Treasuries, or Issued from them. The rupee was thus standardized at 
the four mints of Patna, Murshedabad, Dacca, and Calcutta. This rupee 
had its value determined by assays made in Calcutta, and after 1794 was 
the only rupee declared to be legal tender, being called the " sicca " rupee. 



138 

In compliance with an order of 1805 acquisition of the Mint house was 
made in May 1806 for Rs. 12,000. Work started the same year as soon 
as Mi. Robert Blake arrived from the Patna mint, and installed himself 
as the first Assay Master. The staff of the old Bangash mint was taken 
over, and since the work was entirely by manual labour at first, there 
was no difficulty in commencing to strike coins. Old customs, such as 
that of annually distributing charity to a number of Brahmans, were 
continued. The new establishment, however, had hardly begun its 
operations, when the building was struck by lightning on the #5th April 
1807 and burnt to the ground. The new premises were laid out on a more 
extensive scale, there being separate buildings for the Assay office and the 
Mint. Several tiled sheds accommodated a dozen or more rough carts, 
which conveyed the treasure to other stations, and were called " tumbrils." 
There were also the usual godowns and store rooms. The Mint was 
visited on the 21st June 1815 by the Marquis of Hastings. The process 
of coining was displayed to the King of Oudh's minister, who had been 
brought by the Governor-General to view it. Mr. Blake was still in 
charge, and showed the two visitors a number of chemical experiments. 
By this date the Mint had become most active and was turning out sixty 
thousand rupees daily. In the early nineteenth century the Raja of 
Bharatpur was fined two million Farrukhabad rupees for taking part in the 
Mahratta War. It is evident that the rupees were circulating widely and 
in great numbers. 

There are many references to the working of the Mint iu the district 
records up to 1884. The Collector was generally the " Mint Master," 
and he received an extra allowance of Rs. S50 for this duty. The most 
important official was obviously the Assay Master, who was necessarily an 
expert, and under him was the Foreman. The two Robert Blakes, father 
and son, followed by Alexander Melville, are the most frequently 
mentioned Assay Masters. W. Stacy, a foreman, died in 1817, and from 
an application for pension by his widow some details about his training 
are available. He was an orphan at an early age. When he was fourteen 
years old he was taken from the Upper School of the Orphanage at 
Calcutta, and was placed in the Calcutta Mint as an apprentice to 



189 

Government. By 1817 he had served twenty-four years. At Calcutta 
he was paid Rs. 200 monthly and Rs. 250 at Fatehgarh. 

The Farrukhabad rupee weighed 169*2 grains troy of which 158*2 
grains were silver. It was in great favour even as late as 1882, when 
the Commissioner tried to have the Mint reopened at Fatehgarh. He 
remarked in his letter: " With landlord and tenant, it is a general 
practice, when their circumstances are prosperous, to melt down Farmkha- 
bad rupees for ornaments for wives and children." The rupees come to 
light as buried treasure, sometimes in hundreds, and in 1934 the market 
price of a single rupee is ten annas. The coins are found to have three 
kinds of milling. In the period 1803-19 the old standard rupee was 
given an oblique milling. Upright milling characterizes coins struck at 
Fatehgarh from 1819 to 1824 and those struck at Calcutta from 1824 to 
1833; while the Farrukhabad rupee made at Calcutta from 1833 to 1835 
has a plain edge and a plain rim on the face. In 1835 the Company 
ordered coins to be struck with the portrait of King William IV. All 
Farrukhabad rupees, made by the East India Company, bear the date 
" 45th year of the reign of Shah Alam." The inscription on the obverse 
was as follows : *' The Emperor Shah Alam, Defender of the Mohamedan 
Faith, Reflector of the Divine Excellence, struck this coin to be current 
in the seven climes." On the reverse was written : " Struck at 
Farrukhabad in the 45th year of his prosperous reign." 

The bulk of the staff were lowly-paid subordinates. Office corres- 
pondence was conducted by the Collector of the District, and his 
supervision was in proportion to the amount of interest he had in the work. 
Some Collectors, like H. Newnham, were experts in minting coins, and 
were continually improving apparatus. Under the Collector was the 
Assay Master, who seems to have lived on the premises. Mr. Robert 
Blake, senior, was responsible for the actual manufacture of coins from 
1806 until his death in 1817. His work was his hobby, and added to his 
accomplishments in chemistry was a passion for collecting books on mints 
and the processes of coining, which produced a library worthy of being 
acquired by Government after his death. Neither his grave, nor that of 
Stacy, his foreman, who died in the same year at Fatehgarh, are traceable. 



140 

Mr. Alexander Melville was the next Assay Master. Robert Blake, 
junior, came from Bengal to take the place of Stacy. He was a worthy 
son of his father, and officiated as Assay Master on several occasions. 
The chief of the subordinate staff was the Superintendent of Meltings, who 
looked after a whole corps of " durabs," who were paid 4 A annas per cent 
for cutting up ingots and stamping them ; blacksmiths, who worked at 
forges ; carpenters ; purveyors of charcoal and wood ; and refiners, who 
melted down bullion and old coins. The refiners were heavily worked, for 
masses of coin were received daily from the public for re-coinage. In 1817 
Dilsukh Rai, a mahajan of the City, brought 7,660 Benares rupees to the 
Mint for this purpose. The charges of refining were Rs. 57/7/2. There 
was at this period a mint at Benares, which coined a different rupee. 

Mr. Newnham, the Mint Master in 1820, was responsible for 
supplanting manual labour by machinery. He had found two laminating 
and cutting machines lying in the storeroom, and by setting them up with 
improvements was able to produce fifty thousand coins by each machine 
as against the sixty thousand, which was the entire daily output of the 
Mint up to that time. A building was erected for the machines. Not 
only was the output increased, but the average cost of minting rupees 
was less. It cost Rs. 200 to make a lakh of rupees by using laminating 
machines and Rs. 512/8 by the malleating system. In 1820 the Mint 
was working letter than ever before under the new system, and other 
mints were supplied with machines. Twelve small cutting machines, for 
example, one laminating mill, and two stamping presses were sent to 
Benares. At the beginning of 1824 the Mint came to an end, and 
Mr. Newnham had to get the machinery sent to Calcutta by boat. A 
large pair of scales, and a box capable of holding six lakhs of rupees were 
the last relics of the old Mint, and were to be seen in the Treasury at the 
Collectorate down to the Mutiny. In August the Collector took posses- 
sion of the buildings, and installed his office in them. The records are 
silent as to which building the Collector had vacated in order to come to 
the Mint. The old court house had been demolished in 1814 by Mr. 
Donnithorne, when he built a residence for himself on the site of the 
Engine Shed at Kasim Bagh. 



141 

The Mint was occupied up to 1829. In consequence of its bad state 
of disrepair in that year, it was abandoned by the Collector, Mr. Nisbet, 
who rented Donnithorne's old house for a year, until the Mint buildings 
had been patched up again. The main block was not suitable for the 
Collector's office. In 1832 Mr. Pidcock made a determined attempt to 
oust the Judge from his court house, and exchange the Mint for the more 
commodious building, which still is to be seen by the modern Collectorate 
office. From Mr. Pidcock's letters the rooms in the Mint appear to have 
l&gt;een small. From his description the shape and arrangement of the 
building resembled that of the long narrow house, standing to-day upon 
the same place. It is obvious that the old foundations were utilised after 
the Mutiny for the modern house. The room, used by the Collector 
himself in 1832, was 23 feet by 17 feet in size, and as he complained : 
" respiration in the hot weather was a matter of great difficulty !" One 
of the Mint buildings in the compound was used as a guard room. The .** 
room in which records were stored, had a small gallery running round 
the walls to give access to "shelves near the ceiling. An interesting 
comment by the Judge, Mr. Shore, was that the Collector was nearer by 
a mile to the City and the Jail than he was. To modern residents this 
statement might seem impossible to understand ; but it must be remembered 
that the only road to the City then was the Qadri Gate Road, which 
runs by the parade ground to the Railway Lines, and the old Jail was 
on this road. The Judge also remarked that the Mint was half a mile 
nearer to the small Jail, by which he alluded to the Commissariat Godown 
behind Colonelganj. This place received the overflow of prisoners from 
" the great Jail " for many years. 

In 1834 the Collector, having taken over the District Magistrate's 
office, returned to Sah Behari Lai's house. The Mint house remained 
empty. In 1844 Government sold the property for Rs. 1,475 to James 
Mercer, the Registrar. He sold it almost at once for Rs. 2,500 to Mrs. 
Charlotte Brierly, the wife of Joseph Brierly, the merchant. Both 
Charlotte Brierly and her husband perished in the Mutiny. Between 
this period and 1857 the house is invariably recorded as the residence of 
the " Kot Sahib Captan," who might possibly have been the Barrack 



142 

Master in charge of the Military Works Department. " Kothi Sahib 
Captan," or officer in charge of buildings, has been suggested as the full 
title. In 1857 the occupants were Lieutenant Monckton and his family, 
who were all killed at Cawnpore on Juue 12th, after escaping in the first 
boat flotilla. In 1858 Brigadier-General Seaton had his Brigade office 
here, when the Station was re-occupied. He was followed by the 
Superintendent of Telegraphs. Nearer to the present day the house was 
formed into quarters for the Ordnance Staff connected with the Gun 
Carriage Agency. 

TIIK INDIAN MILITARY HOSPITAL. 

This building from 18*31 to 18*37 was the palace of Nawab Hakim 
Mehdi AM Khan, Muntazim-ud-Dowlah, who was several times Vizier of 
Oudh. He was born about 1750, and raising himself from the condition 
of soldier of fortune to the highest posts in the State, he accumulated in 
the process a vast store of wealth, which led to his downfall. In 1819 he 
fell into disgrace and went into his first exile, arriving at Fatehgarh from 
Shahjahanpore about 1822. Two years later it is certain that he built 
the Military Engineer's Godown in front of the Fort as a hostel for 
travellers. In the course of the next ten years he executed many public 
works and acquired property in Fatehgarh. He constructed the suspen- 
sion bridge at Khudaganj, the ruins of which remain to this day, the 
bridge having fallen into disuse after 1880. A well and a mosque in the 
Heysham Serai behind the Company Garden, the present Collector's 
residence, and this large house for his own use, were ready and in use 
within a few years of his arrival. Minor works, such as the bridge by 
the golf links, which were due to his initiative, are too numerous for 
mention. He built a school in the Town and set up a Kashmir Shawl 
Factory. In addition, he owned Nos. 4, 6\ and 20 Bungalows, the 
present Judge's house, Colonel Brown's house at Rakha, houses in 
Fatehgarh Town and Husainpur, and several walled gardens. In 1830 
he was invited back to Luck now, but in March 1883 he was a second time 
exiled to Fatehgarh. When finally permission to return was given, the 



143 

old Nawab died after a few months ou the 25th December 1887. Ke was 
succeeded by his nephew, Munawwar-ud-Dowiah, or " the General," as he 
was called at Fatehgarh, who erected his mausoleum in Golaganj at 
Lucknow. 

In the eighteenth century this compound was part of the Infantry 
Lines, and it was called " the right of the line." There is no record of 
the condition of the site, when the Nawab bought it. Fortunately, some 
description of the buildings as they were in 18529 and succeeding years, 
has been made by visitors, but there is no mention anywhere as to how 
the land was acquired. The compound was roughly square, for the 
triangular plot to the south-west was up to 1880 part of the parade 
ground. The entrance to the grounds was imposing, since one passed 
through a lofty gateway, surmounted by the musicians 1 gallery, and 
flanked by guard rooms. All traces of this gate disappeared after the 
Mutinyr It stood a few yards to the north of the present entrance, and 
about opposite to the entrance of Bungalow No. 3 and the tomb of 
Catherine P. In the south-western part of the enclosure was a walled 
garden, containing three fountains, and pooU filled with gold fish. Inside, 
long narrow rooms with verandahs, supported by columns, looked on to the 
garden. This collection of walls and buildings constituted the zenana, 
which was duly visited by Mrs. Fanny Parks. 

The main building has been slightly changed by the addition of side 
verandahs and the walling up of its. fine portico, which was a facsimile of 
that still to be seen at the Collector's house, and of the kind known as 
" Elephant porticos," since they were high enough to allow of an elephant 
passing through. The rooms and the roof have been restored ; but the 
cement is still that of the original builder. The house was not damaged 
in the Mutiny, and at the reoccupation of Fatehgarh was turned into a 
military hospital. The centre room with its massive columns was used 
by Nawab Hakim Mehdi AM Khan as his tazia khana ; and here were kept 
the tazias, or models of the tomb of King Hussain, only displayed at 
religious festivals. From the ceiling of the room hung a multitude of 
glass chandeliers of every colour and make. The other rooms of the house 
were crammed with curios. Down the centre of each ran long tables, 



144 

covered with valuable articles and also rubbish ; while around the walls 
were glass cases full of clocks, watches, swords, guns, and pistols. Several 
of the rooms were magnificently furnished in European style, the walls 
being covered with a profusion of pier glasses, mirrors, and badly coloured 
prints in beautiful frames. In every room French organs, clocks, and 
mechanical toys, struck an incongruous note. The house was more like a 
museum than the living quarters of its owner. The private Imambara, 
which he made for his own devotions, stands to the north of the house; 
and further on across the modern road were the coach house and stables 
for horses and elephants, which were then part of the compound and not 
cut off by any road as at present. The Nawab had here a stud of English 
and Arab horses, of which he was justly proud, and it was his habit to 
parade his horses for the inspection of visitors, who had been invited to 
breakfast. The road on the west, which now divides the Hospital 
compound from that of the Mint, was in use from the beginning of the 
nineteenth century. Instead, however, of veering to the east, it proceeded 
in a north-westerly direction towards the Fort, and cut through the 
Husainpur bazar. It can be traced now, and the remains of an old bridge, 
over which it passed, are to be seen half way. The eastern extension 
along the edge of No. 2 Compound was made after the Mutiny by 
Brigadier Seaton. When the house was turned into a British General 
Hospital in 1858, alterations were made in the compound, and the stables 
and other buildings were demolished. The old gate house and zenana 
were both levelled to the ground. 

There are several accounts by contemporaries of this famous man's 
appearance, the best of which are by Mrs. Fanny Parks and Captain 
Mundy. He was of Persian descent and hailed from Kashmir. He was 
already over seventy years old, when he first came to Fatehgarh. In 
person he was tall, thin and rather bowed. His head was bald, and his 
features small, usually wearing a very bland expression. Mrs. Parks has 
described his costume on the occasion of his paying a call on her at the 
present Collector's house. He was attired in brown corduroy breeches, 
black leather boots, and gloves. He wore a dress of white flowered Dacca 
muslin and a coat of pale pink satin, embroidered in gold. On his head 



145 

was a turban of red and gold Benares tissue. He held a sword in his 
hand, while behind him a servant carried the huqqa. Mrs. Parks had 
met him in Lucknow in 1831 before the visit to Fatehgarh. Then he 
seemed an old man, sinking beneath the weight of years, with a totally 
bald head. At the reception of the King of Oudh he was almost unable 
to stand up by reason of the dresses of honour and shawls which he was 
wearing. The first dress of honour at this durbar was presented to him, 
but the dress being too small, the aged Nawab could only get one arm 
into it. He stood there shaking*, probably because he thought it was a 
bad omen, according to Mrs. Parks. It was an unlucky omen as it 
turned out. The old man was an inveterate intriguer, and his immense 
wealth made him a source of danger to the King of Oudh. It was only 
two years after this durbar that he was exiled again from Lucknow, 
Captain Mundy describes a dinner given to Lord Combermere, the 
Commander-in-Chief, on the 20th December 1828 in this house. Forty 
guests, including the ladies of the Station, sat down to this banquet. 
Lord Combermere had breakfast here on both his visits to Fatehgarh in 
1827 and 1828. The table was always well served ; and on the removal 
of the cloth, it was the Nawab's custom to display French cuckoo clocks 
and musical boxes, of which he was extremely fond. After one breakfast 
he conducted his guests to a side room, opening on to a grass plot, and 
showed his stud of Arab horses. He was popular in the Station, and had 
the manners of a great noble. It Is related that he gave a grand enter- 
tainment here on the occasion of the marriage of a relation. In the 
middle, a string of valuable pearls round his neck broke, the pearls rolling 
over the floor. Refusing to disturb the party, he took no notice, and 
allowed no one to move. This may well have been the very necklace 
noted by Mrs. Parks, who sat opposite to him at a Lucknow dinner in 
1831. " All dinner," she writes, " he was telling his beads on a rosary 
of enormous pearls " 

In 1859 Munawwar-ud-Dowlah bestowed on Government all property, 
which, he had inherited from Nawab Hakim Mehdi Ali Khan, but 
Government insisted on compensating him. He stipulated that the 
I mam bara and a cemetery should be excluded. The Brigadier Com- 



140 

manding had taken the former building along with the house, but promised 
to maintain it. The cemetery was separated from the compound, and no 
trace of it can now be found. The property was valued at Rs. 10,000, 

THE OLD HOSPITAL. 

North-east of No. 2 Bungalow, overlooking Hospital Ghat, was the 
enclosure of the Cantonment Hospital for fifty years up to the Mutiny. 
Examination of the ground will disclose the old foundations. Before 
1795 the hospitals of the Temporary Brigade were built of such flimsy 
materials as to be capable of transference at a moment's notice from one 
spot to another within the Lines, and they were always being blown over, 
or destroyed, by gales and heavy rains. In December 1777 Colonel 
Leslie reported that he had built two hospital sheds temporarily in the 
Infantry Lines. In May 1778 Lt. -Colonel Wilding described the 
Hospital as being between the Infantry and the Cavalry Lines. From 
his letter it is learnt that the hospital was a thatched shed, supported on 
posts of mango wood, and possessing mat sides. In April 1795 the 
European Hospital, so-called, was in the Cavalry Lines at Rakha. The 
artillery had their own arrangements in the Fort. The European 
Hospital is difficult to place. It appears to have been either in the 
Company Garden, or in the compound of the Collectorate. In 1795, 
however, it was moved, and to a place where for the first time it can 
definitely be located. Three bungalows, which up to that year had 
housed the offices and personnel of Brigade Headquarters, were purchased 
from an officer, and were put in repair for the use of the European 
artillery. The artillery refused to move from their quarters, as they 
contemplated occupying the Fort, in which they could build their own 
offices and houses. These bungalows, being in good condition, were then 
taken over for the Hospital. The northernmost one overlooked Hospital 
Ghat, and was allotted to the Head Surgeon for a residence. The 
Cantonment Hospital afterwards stood upon its foundations. A large 
bungalow to the north was turned into the General Hospital for 
Europeans and Indians. This was twenty years later called " Martin's 



147 

House", .having been purchased by the indigo planter of that name. 
Its full history is related below. The third and smallest bungalow was 
that which is marked on the 1885 map as belonging to Abdul Rahman, 
the Deputy Collector. It stood a few yards to the north of No. 2 
Bungalow, and not a trace of it is left today. AM three bungalows were 
thatched and mud plastered as was usual in the eighteenth century. 

At the time of the formation of the Temporary Brigade many 
officers held military and medical rank simultaneously. Ultimately they 
had to decide their choice. An actual case occurred at Fatehgarh. On 
the Ilth May 1787 Lieutenant Thomas Staunton addressed a letter to 
T. Hamilton Esquire, Senior Surgeon at the Hospital, asking to be 
appointed Regimental Surgeon's Mate to the 8th Battalion, in which 
corps he was serving as a combatant officer, Hamilton, whose tomb in 
the District Courts' compound is the oldest in Fatehgarh and in excellent 
preservation, forwarded the letter to the Medical Board at Calcutta. 
The petition was rejected. Staunton continued to serve as a combatant 
officer He died at Fatehgarh in 1805. An account of his court-martial 
has been given iu chapter XII. 

The inscription on Hamilton's tomb shows his rank to be that of a 
Head Surgeon. He was the first at Fatehgarh. In 1786 there were only 
three General Hospitals outside Calcutta. Two more were sanctioned, 
and one of them was to be at Fatehgarh. Hamilton had served as a 
military Assistant Surgeon since 1768, and as Head Surgeon he was still 
in military employ. In 1773 he signed a memorial which claimed the 
right for military Assistant Surgeons to retain civil appointments, but 
the memorial did not succeed. This General Hospital was a military 
one, the civil population at the time consisting of only a few planters and 
traders. Up to 1795 it was probably in the vicinity of Hamilton's 
house, which must have been near his tomb. Hamilton had three 
Assistant Surgeons under him. 

In 1795 the General Hospital was moved, as has been seen, under 
the Superintendence of W. I. Gardner, the then Head Surgeon. Only one 
other Head Surgeon comes into notice, and he was the last. Doctor 
Peter Cochrane was Assistant in 1780, full Surgeon in 1790, and Head 



148 

Surgeon was in 1805. He in charge at Fatehgarh from 1803 to 1807. He 
became President of the Medical Board in 1815, retired in 1821, and 
died ten years later at Beauvais in France. At the end of the eighteenth 
century Government used to give regimental surgeons contracts for the 
supply of medicines and diet for the patients. Cochrane is said to have 
made a large fortune by supplying Lord Lake's camp with such 
necessaries from Fatehgarh during the second Mahratta War. During 
his time a Superintendent of Vaccination was added to the staff. 

After 1807 the medical charge of Fatehgarh was given to an 
Assistant Surgeon. The General Hospital disappeared, and the house 
was bought by Martin. The Cantonment Hospital came into being. 
It WHS housed in the bungalow overlooking the ghat, where the Head 
Surgeon had resided. Here it remained until the outbreak of the 
Mutiny. The civil population was now increasing at the expense of the 
military ; and the Assistant Surgeon became Civil Surgeon in addition. 
The following Civil Surgeons are recorded after Cochrane : — 

1. Bernard Reilly, 1808-16. Buried in the Fort Cemetery. In 
1812 he was refused an allowance by the Governor-General for 

attending on persons attached to the Ceded Provinces' Board. He 
was presented to the Marquis of Hastings at one of the Fatehgarh 
levees in 1815. 

2. J. Johnston. 1816-24. He resided in No. J) Bungalow. 
In 1817 a scheme was set on foot for a hospital in Fatehgarh Town, 
which may be regarded as the precursor of the Civil Hospital. 
Funds were raised by subscription from the residents of the Station ; 
and the Governor-General on behalf the East India Company 
donated a monthly grant of 150 sicca rupees. The Hospital was 
located in the Sudder Bazar, and its site was opposite the present 
Municipal Office. Here it remained until 1870, when new buildings 
were erected in the compound of the old Church at a cost of 
Rs. 5,680. The west end and tower of the Chuich were converted into 
wards, and added to the Hospital. A large subscription was given 
by one Panna Lai, and the new establishment was often called after 
his name. 



149 

3. Julius Jeffreys. 1825-31. He is said to have been the first 
to suggest Simla as a hill station. In 1836 he invented the respirator. 
He went in for trade, and was a local manufacturer of saltpetre. 

4. J. Goss. 1832-40. Mentioned by Miss Eden in her "Up 
the Country Letters '\ He was an eccentric character, who had 
eventually to leave on medical certificate. He made experiments iu 
magnetism, and had curious notions on the situation of the North Pole. 

5. T. C. Hunter. 1841-44. Traces of him are to be found in 
the Registrar's Office ; for he lent money on mortgages of landed 
property. He resided in a house, the site of which is now covered 
by the compound of the District Traffic Superintendent. He died 
at Cawnpore in 1858 as a result of hardships experienced during the 
Mutiny. 

6. G. Grant. 1845-46. Lived in No. 19 Bungalow. 

7. W. B. Macleod. 1847 48. Lived in No. 19 Bungalow. 
His wife is buried in the Fort cemetery. He received the decoration 
of the C. B. in 1850. 

8. Dr. Gerrard. 1848-49. 

9. A. J. Payne. 1849-51. Still living in 1913. 

10. S. Maltby. 1852-57. Killed at Cawnpore, 1857. 

With one or two exceptions all Civil Surgeons lived in No. 19 
Bungalow. 

Hospital affairs were managed by a body, calling itself the Dis- 
pensary Committee. Most of the records extant deal with its operations 
in the City, where two dispensaries were working by 1840. There was 
also a hospital in the Jail. In addition to his medical duties, the Civil 
Surgeon was postmaster for the District. Not seldom he served as 
secretary on many and various local committees, such as those looking 
after the roads, or the Farrukhabad School. 

THE PARK. 

In 1850 a property of 150 acres in extent was formed by the direc- 
tions of the Government of India for Maharaja Dhuleep Singh of the 



150 

Punjab, on his being sent from Lahore to live at Fatehgarh. A Doctor 
Login (afterwards Sir John Login) accompanied him as guardian, for the 
Maharaja was young boy, and his education had to be supervised. Doctor 
Login acquired all the land within the space which stretched from Rani 
Ghat up to and including the present Officers' Mess and No. 4 Bungalow. 
This area was then called " The Park ". The 1835 map will show that a 
number of residences were dotted about in it, the biggest of which was 
Martin's House. Doctor Login purchased them all for the Maharaja, 
and breaking down the compound walls, threw them into one. Very little 
has been discovered about their previous history. Out of nine houses 
only two remain in use to-day, and even they are not the original struc- 
tures. Five disappeared in the Mutiny, and were never rebuilt. Two 
were demolished in 1925. The sole remaining houses in the Park are 
numl&gt;ered 4 and 5, the latter being more generally known as the Officers' 
Mess, and since they were always part of the Park property, they will be 
more conveniently described along with the others purchased by Maharaja 
Dhuleep Singh. 

It has already been shown that this corner of Fatehgarh ('amp had 
been in occupation since the coming of the Temporary Brigade ; and 
Captain Primrose Thompson marked out sites for officers' quarters along 
the bank of the Ganges from Hospital Ghat to Bargadia Ghat. From 
the records of the eighteenth century it appeirs that the bungalows, mere- 
ly thatched roofs supported by mud walls, were erected by the first comers 
themselves, and passed on from officer to officer by sale, each occupant 
contributing some improvement to the property. In this manner the 
large house, known as " Martin's House", had passed into the possession 
of Government by purchase from Major Pringle, the Barrack Master, for 
4,785 sicca rupees in April 1795. For the next twelve years the General 
Hospital for Europeans and Indians was set up here; and the establish- 
ment was moved to more modest quarters in the old Head Surgeon's 
house by Hospital Ghat, when Fatehgarh ceased to be the headquarters 
of a brigade. Mr. Martin acquired the house in 1807 at a time when all 
the old houses in Cantonments were passing into the hands of wealthy 
indigo planters and cotton merchants. Of Martin there are very scanty 



151 

details. He was connected with the indigo planting at Shamsabad, and 
the Fatehgarh-nama mentions him as a wealthy planter, who had lost his 
money by 1887. His decline, however, began long before that date. In 
1825 he was forced to assign the house to a banker, named Seth Lachmi 
Chand, in redemption of a loan. He himself lived probably in a house, 
surrounded by groves of trees, close to the present rifle range by the 
Fort. It is known that at any rate he was the owner of it. 

Martin's House is interesting in more than one way. It is the only 
pre-Mutiny house of which a contemporary plan has been found. Al- 
though they passed away more than_ seventy-five years ago, the boundaries 
of its garden are known, and it is easier to conjure up a picture of this 
house than of any of the others which disappeared in the Mutiny, and 
are only known by name and a few slight traces on the ground. The 
gateway of the compound can be made out at a spot nearly opposite the 
entrance to the compound of No. 2 Bungalow, where in fact a path leads 
across the old garden to Rani Ghat. Proceeding in a perfectly straight 
line from the gate of No. 2 Bungalow towards the Ganges, the site of the 
house will be seen on the high ground overlooking the river. A canton- 
ment incinerator marks the spot. To the north is the deep gully leading 
to Rani Ghat, which was converted into a private road by Maharaja 
Dhuleep Singh. It is said to have been a covered way, so that the 
Maharaja's sister-in-law could go to bathe in the Ganges without being 
seen. The Maharaja kept his boats moored by the pipal tree at the ghat. 
Another story is that a Rani, sailing down the Ganges in the times of the 
Mahratta raids, landed here to secrete her jewels. This tradition has 
given rise to treasure seeking operations in No. 2 Compound, which have 
left their mark. The compound was bounded on the south by the wide 
nullah, which here bisects the Park. The nullah was crossed by a bridge, 
the remains of which can be seen buried in the undergrowth, and the 
house had a south entrance beyond it. The stables and servants houses 
lined the nullah by this gate. The house itself was flat roofed and solidly 
built. The drawing room was within fifty yards of the stream, which 
was approached by a sloping bank. The interior of the house was of the 
type which is usually to be seen in pre-Mutiny brick houses. The chief 



152 

rooms were three lofty ones in the centre. They were divided from each 
other by arches, or columns. This arrangement can be seen perfectly in 
the present Collector's house. The front verandah, which faced No. 2 
Bungalow, was approached by a flight of steps. The bedroom was on 
the north side, the coolest side of the house, and disproportionately small. 
The odd feature was that on the south side there were no rooms at all, 
but a walled garden was attached to it. Although the house was a large 
one, it had only an antechamber and three chief living rooms. 

The first occupant, who is known, was Mr. Nisbet (Collector 1829-32. 
Died 1882). The next Collector did not take the house, and at this date 
the chief officials lived anywhere they liked in the Station. This house, 
however, was a favourite both of Collectors and Judges, and, indeed, it 
had one of the best situations in Fatchgarh. Its most famous tenant was 
probably the Hon. F. J. Shore (Judge" 1831-35. Died 1837), the son of 
Sir John Shore, afterwards Lord Teignmouth, who as Governor-General 
in 1796 had been so concerned over the mutinous conduct of the Fateh- 
garh garrison. Mr. Shore was the last Judge Magistrate and the first 
Sessions Judge of the District. There are numerous letters of his in the 
records, which reveal him to have been an official of sound common sense, 
and in ideas startingly modern. In spite of personal eccentricities, which 
he probably exaggerated, he was far in advance of his times. His " Notes 
on Indian Affairs " created some sensation when they were published. 
His account of a district officer's work under the East India Company's 
Government is all the more interesting because it tells of conditions in 
Farrukhabad District, and was written just after he had left on transfer 
to Dehra Dun. He invented the well-known treadmill in the Jail, and 
took to wearing Mussalman costume. This foible was the cause of a 
Government order, which forbade the Company's officers to adopt such 
dress. A contemporary description of him in 1827 by Captain Mundy. 
is as follows: " A till handsome man with a long beard, and dressed in 
Mussalman costume. A great shikarri, the verandahs and rooms of his 
house filled with stuffed animals. He had two tame bears which sat either 
side of him at meals, and ate their food out of wooden howls." In one of 
his letters Shore refers to his having been stationed in Fatehgarh in 1820. 



158 

He came out to India only two years before, and must have been an 
Assistant Collector. He spent a good deal of money on the house, and 
much beautified the grounds. In a very interesting letter of 183J2 ho 
describes an incident at the house, in which he narrowly escaped a mur- 
derous assault. It was his custom to have arrested persons brought to 
the house by the Police, so that he could personally interrogate them. A 
person who had been arrested for murder, was sitting under the porch 
by the front steps, guarded by policemen, while Shore himself was work- 
ing in the antechamber with several court officials around him. Suddenly 
the prisoner stood upright, seized a sword from one of the policemen, and 
cut both his guards down. Leaping up the steps, he rushed into the 
room, and darted at Shore who was seated at a table. The Nazir, who 
was standing by the table, seized the man and after receiving several 
wounds in the process, forced him into a corner of the room, where he was 
secured. Shore says the whole incident was over in a few seconds, and 
but for the promptitude of the Nazir, he could not have escaped injury. 
He had hardly time to scramble to his feet and get his own sword, an in- 
teresting sidelight on the customs of 183#, when the Magistrate apparently 
kept a sword by him for protection, or as part of his magisterial equipment! 
There is no information as to who succeeded Mr. Shore in the house. 
Mr. Robinson, Collector at the time, lived in the last house in the Civil 
Lines (see chapter X). In 1837 Mr. Campbell (Collector 1837-43) took 
up his abode here, and for the next twelve years Martin's House changed 
its name to that of u The Collector's House ", and all the permanent 
Collectors of that period adopted it as their residence. Mr. Trench 
(1843-44) and Mr. Gubbins (1844-45) followed in turn as tenants. The 
latter afterwards became Financial Commissioner of Oudh, and wrote au 
account of the Mutinies in that province. Gubbins* House in the Residency 
Compound in Lucknow was one of the famous posts held during the siege. 
Mr. Gubbins left at the end of the year, and the house was temporarily 
vacant, the new Collector, Mr. Astell (1845-47) not yet having arrived. 
Nawab Doolah of Shamsabad seized the opportunity of using the premises 
for a big dinner to be given to his European and Indian friends. In his 
Persian diary he wrote a most diverting account of this entertainment,

which happily has been written in the only volume of this diary in 
existence. The dinner was fixed foi: the 15th December 1845. Mr. 
James Mercer (1788-1853. Buried in the Fort cemetery), the Sub- 
ordinate Judge, made all the arrangements, and his cook prepared both 
the English and Hindustani dinners. 

At 7 p. m. on the 15th December the guests began to arrive. From 
the gate (near the entrance of No. 2, Bungalow) up to the house door 
were rows of lighted lamps, between which the guests drove up in their 
buggies and phaetons to be received by the Nawab and Mr. Mercer on 
the house steps. They then passed into the drawing room, and were 
made to sit in a large circle around the fire, until Mr. Tyler (retired 
1854. Died 1891), the Judge and Agent to the Governor-General, made 
his ceremonious arrival. Meanwhile the band of the 43rd N. 1. took up 
their station in a corner of the room, and commenced to play es soon as 
the company had departed to a round room on the north side for dinner. 
Twenty-two persons sat down, the Hindustani guests having already 
started dinner in another room adjoining. The chief guests, besides 
Mr. Tyler, were a Colonel Watts and Captain Cutler, both of the British 
Army ; Mr. Turner of the Board of Revenue (Judge at Fatehgarh in 
1826. Died 1866) ; Mr. Maclean (a planter from Shahjahanpur, who 
afterwards resided in No. # Bungalow, and was killed in the Mutiny) ; 
Mr. Moir, a trader and planter, (living in the present Haja of Tirwa's 
house) ; R. J. Tucker (Joint Magistrate); Doctor Hunter (Civil Surgeon); 
Major A. Tucker (1803-91. Agent Clothing Factory) ; and Major 
Abbott (1804-67. Agent Gun Carriage Factory). 

Nawab Doolah wrote down the subjects of conversation at dinner in 
great detail. The merits of Simla, Subathu, and Mussoorie as hill stations 
were canvassed, after which followed a long discussion on China and 
Thibet. The guests drank a good deal of wine out of glasses of different 
colours. When dessert was put on the table, Mr. MacWhirter (a Deputy 
Collector) smoked his huqqa. The Nawab probably noted this, because 
the practice was in 1845 an old-fashioned one, the huqqa having been 
supplanted by cheroots. Mr. Tyler gave the toast of the Queen, where- 
upon all stood up and drank to her health. Next, the guests lifted up 



155 

their glasses and drank to the health of their host. " I salaamed/ 1 writes 
the gratified Nawab, " and the guests shouted hip hip hurrah at the top 
of their voices. 1 ' The whole company, conducted by the Nawab then 
trooped out of the house, and sat shivering with cold on the chabutra in 
order to watch a display of fireworks on the Ganges, which lasted two 
hours. At a late hour return was made to the drawing room to watch a 
nautch dance. Cardamons were distributed, aud each guest was decora- 
ted with a garland. Supper was then served. The Nawab left at this 
stage, and the rest of his observations are the result of his enquiries next 
morning. Mr. MacWhirtcr made the nautch dancers also have supper ; 
and much wine was consumed, Mr. MacWhirtcr himself becoming so 
inebriated as to fall down and take no further part in the proceedings. 
Mr. Mercer and many other guests, extremely tipsy, were carried to their 
homes in palanquins. 

After Mr. Astell two other Collectors had their residence in the old 
house before it was altered for Maharaja Dhuleep Singh, namely, 
Mr. Timins (1847-49) and Mr. Cunninghamc (1849-56). The latter, 
however, vacated the house in November 1S50. All the houses in the 
Park had been acquired in April, and this house had been left to the last 
out of deference to the Collector. Doctor Login purchased it from Seth 
Lachmi Chand for Rs. 15,000. The house was rebuilt and enlarged. 
Doctor Login had noted its fine centre rooms, and with additional rooms 
on both sides of them, he prepared a residence for the Maharaja himself, 
which was impressive enough to be styled a palace by the Times War 
Correspondent in 1858. The rooms were furnished throughout in 
European style with the best English furniture. Lord Dalhousic, the 
Governor-General, visited Fatehgarh in 1851, expressly to see if the 
Maharaja was comfortable. He visited the house on the 25th December, 
inspecting the rooms and the grounds. The Maharaja expressed his 
intention of becoming a Christian, and there was some talk with the 
Governor-General about it. On the 8th March 1853 he was actually 
baptised by Mr. Jay, the Chaplain, in this very house. 

The Maharaja took up his residence here from 1851 to February 
1854 when he left for England. He never returned to Fatehgarh 



156 

Mr. Buller (Judge 1852-56) was permitted to move in some time during 
1854, as there seemed no prospect of the Maharaja's return. After Mr. 
Buller came Mr. R.B. Thornhill (1856-57), who was killed at Cawnpore 
with the other fugitives from Fatehgarh during the Mutiny. It has not 
l&gt;een possible to discover any reason why the District Judges deserted 
their old residence (the present Collector's house). Nawab Doolah makes 
a curt entry in his diary to the effect that Mr. Buller in 1852 could not 
obtain any house, and was living in tents behind the Judge's court house. 
Eventually he found lodging in the present Judge's house, but moved 
later to the Maharaja's place. All the houses in the Park were found to 
be in the possession of various officers, when the Mutiny broke out. They 
had been put into good order by Doctor Login, and the Maharaja 
apparently preferred not to let them stand empty. There is a very slight 
clue to the residence of Mr. Thornhill being in the Park, and as the 
occupants of nearly all the other bungalows are known, he must have 
followed Mr. Buller in the Maharaja's own house. Mrs. Thornhill was a 
grand-daughter of the famous actress, Mrs. Siddons. Very likely it was 
in this house that during the dark days preceding the outbreak of the 
Mutiny on the 17th June 1857, Mrs. Thornhill worked hard at preparing 
Indian costumes as disguises for her family with the help of the wife of 
Mohamed Saieed Khan, a clerk in the Judge's Office. This interesting 
tradition has been communicated by this Indian official's son, Khan 
Bahadur Abdul Hamid Khan, who often heard the story from his mother's 
lips. When the residents of the Station took refuge iu the Fort on the 
18th .Iune, Likha Singh of Allahganj crossed the river and pillaged the 
Maharaja's house, removing the furniture in boat loads. The house 
itself was left a mass of ruins. The Valuation Committee was unable to 
assess it at any good sum. The Maharaja was unlikely ever to return, 
and no one else was willing to rebuild it. The house was therefore 
demolished in 1859, and the site has remained bare ever since. So deso- 
late is the spot that it is difficult to imagine the splendour of this estate, 
laid out with lawns and flower beds, and covered with a profusion of 
flowering trees and shrubs. It is said that there were shady walks in 
every direction, and the Fatehgarh residents were accustomed to visit this 



157 

end of the Station iu order to catch a glimpse of the Maharaja hunting 
with his hawks in the grounds, or emerging from the gates for his morn- 
ing ride. The Maharaja observed due ceremony in his morning outing, 
and the spectacle was a favourite one in Fatehgarh. In the cavalcade 
were his nephew, British officers, and Sikh attendants, all well mounted. 
He was always escorted by a detachment of two Indian officers and twenty- 
five men of the Governor-General's bodyguard in scarlet uniforms, as well 
as by a troop of Skinner's Horse in yellow. In the evening when not 
busy with his hawks, he usually rode in a carriage with four grey Arabs, 
driven by an English coachman. 

A series of households was set up in the other houses within the 
Park. Besides the Maharaja's place, there were eight other residences, 
seven of which were thatched bungalows of varying sizes. In one 
lived the Hani Duknu, the Maharaja's sister-in-law; in a second the 
Diwan and Sikh attendants; iu a third the English tutor, Guise; in a 
fourth Elliott, the steward; iu :i fifth Thornton, the coachman. Two or 
three houses formed a depository for valuable equipment. They were 
called the "toshak khana". The site of the remaining house is occupied 
by the new Officers' Mess of the 10/7th Rajput Regiment, the old house 
which was the abode of Doctor Login, having been pulled down in 1925. 
The mud walled bungalow of the eighteenth century gave way to a brick 
house. The last officer owner sold it to William Jennings, merchant, 
about 180(). Jennings, like Martin and many other adventurers, had no 
capital behind him ; and in 1832 his family fortunes had so declined that 
he had to part with the house to Thomas Churcher, an indigo planter, for 
Rs. 8,000. The Churcher family had to sell out to Doctor Login in 
April 1850. Lady Login writing the memoir of her husband in after 
years, unfortunately made no description of her home at this place ; but 
it was a pleasant one, and from other sources one gathers the Logins did 
much entertaining. Lady Login mentions the bringing of Colonel 
Mountain to this house in 1854. He was accompanying the Commander- 
in-Chief on tour, and was taken ill near Fatehgarh. Despite all that Mrs. 
Mountain and Lady Login could do, the sick man never rallied, and he 
died on the 8th February. Shortly after, the Logins left for England, 



158 

and since there was no chance of their returning, the Maharaja having 
bought an estate in England, the Commanding Officer of the 10th N. I. 
(Lt. -Colonel G. A. Smith) took possession _in 1856. When the mutiny 
of the regiment was immiuent, the house was selected as a rallying point 
for the residents of the Station. The decision, however, was altered in 
favour of the Fort. After the Mutiny the Officers Commanding Fatehgarh 
continued to live in the house up to the year 1880 at least. It was 
finally demolished in 1925 to make way for the new Mess. 

North of the Officers' Mess is a hillock, overlooking the Ganges, 
which was the site of a small bungalow. It was bought by Doctor Login 
along with the big house of Thomas Churcher, and in the sale deed of the 
latter house it is described as the bungalow in the compound with a buggy 
house and servants' quarters. A pensioner, named Assistant Commissary 
Robert Kembali, was the occupier from 1826 to 1842. His daughter, 
Dolly Kembali, was one of the few residents who escaped from Fatehgarh 
in the Mutiny. 

In pre-Mutiny times a road divided the Churcher and Kembali 
houses from No. 4 Bungalow. It started where the gates of the Mess 
now stand, and ran by the present racquet court in a straight line to the 
nullah, which it crossed by a bridge, giving access to the south entrance 
of Martin's compound. The metalled road, which bears to the north- 
west, and crosses the nullah by the existing bridge, is a construction of the 
sixties, when the Park was turned into a soldiers' garden. The gates of 
the Churcher* and Kembali houses stood on the east of this old road; while 
on the west was a bungalow behind No. 4, the lines of which are visible 
on the ground. The metalled road, crosses a corner of the old house, 
which in 1844 belonged to Mr. Mercer, and in that year was his residence, 
for Nawab Doolah used to call upon him there. Houses changed owners 
rapidly in those days. Subordinate officers, clerks, and Eurasian 
residents invested their savings nearly always in the purchase of these 
small bungalows, hoping to make profit by selling them again. Mercer 
sold this house in 1845 to Mrs. Mary Bibi Hennessy, an Indian lady in 
No. 2 Bungalow. In 1846 she sold it to Mrs. Anne Macklin, wife of the 
Collectorate Head Clerk, for s. 500. In 1850 Doctor Login was forced 



151) 

to acquire the compound in order to form the Park propertyR, and Mrs. 
Macklin reaped a handsome profit by getting Rs. 1,700 for this insignifi- 
cant building, which could never have been more than a cottage. 
Macklin, his wife, and eight children were murdered at Cawnpore in 1857 
after getting away from Fatehgarh in the first boat journey. No. 4 
Bungalow had belonged to Nawab Hakim Mehdi Ali Khan. His heir, 
Munawwar-ud-l)owlah, presented it to the Maharaja as a gift. The name 
of not a single one of its occupiers is known. It was a thatched house 
up to recent years, and has been rebuilt with a flat cement roof after an 
outbreak of five. 

West of No. 4 Bungalow is a bare plot, which since 1857 has not 
been built upon. There was, however, always a house here from the 
earliest times up to the Mutiny. It l&gt;elonged to the Paul family, whose 
history has been given in chapter V. In 1848 Musamtnat Joubc Paul, 
widow of " Mr. Paul, shopkeeper," mortgaged the property, which was 
specified as a thatched bungalow with outhouses and six trees including a 
tamarind. This tamarind tree still is to be seen on the northern boun- 
dary, close by the tomb of Catherine Paul, and is a fine specimen of its 
kind. The main entrance to the compound and the front verandah faced 
west, that is, towards the present Indian Military Hospital. The deed 
of mortgage also discloses that Mrs. Paul was known locally as Bibi 
Khubi and Bibi Chhoti, and lived herself in the adjoining bungalow to 
the north. She was undoubtedly the Indian wife of Laurence Paul's son. 
The bungalow she lived in was a very small one, which judging by its 
successor, built on the same foundations, had one main room and two small 
apartments like bathrooms. The thatched house on this site was used as 
the Club library up to 1925 and was only a few yards from No. 3 
Bungalow, which was the Club building. Both these Paul properties were 
sold in 1849 to the Hevd. Gopinath Nande of the American Presbyterian 
Mission at Rakha. He, in turn, had to sell them to Doctor Login within 
eight months for Rs. 2,300. This was a low price for two compounds 
with bungalows and all accessories. 

No. 3 Bungalow can be traced by the only existing relic of Maharaja 
Dhuleep Singh's stay at Fatehgarh. His swimming bath, which was in 



100 

use by Club members up to 1925, remains, open to the sky, to mark the 
site. This house, known in 1880 as No. tt Bungalow, was a long narrow 
building, running east and west, the swimming bath being at its eastern 
end. It was the toshak khana of the Maharaja, where his tents, howdahs, 
and equipment were kept. Sergeant Elliott, formerly of the Bengal 
Sappers, was his steward in charge of this depository, and resided in one 
of the Paul bungalows close by. He married a daughter of Maclean, the 
indigo planter, who was in No. % Bungalow when the Mutiny broke out. 
Elliott remained on in charge of the Maharaja's estate, and wrote by 
every mail to the Logins. His letters, describing the events leading up to 
the Mutiny, were interesting enough to be sent on to Queen Victoria for 
perusal as soon as they arrived in England. Most unfortunately no trace 
of them is now to be found, and a valuable contribution to the history of 
the Mutiny at Fatehgarh has been lost. Long before his last letters 
reached the Logins, the writer, his wife, and five children had lost their 
lives at Cawnpoie. Likka Singh of Allahganj emptied the store houses, 
when he looted the estate, and it was estimated at his trial that he had 
caused the Maharaja a loss of over a lakh of rupees in stealing furniture, 
plate, tents, and equipment. In addition, he had taken the building to 
pieces, brick by brick, in the search for hidden treasure to such good 
purpose that a year later the Valuation Committee could find nothing fco 
value at all. The Maharaja received no compensation from Government 
for his losses, though he applied for it. 

The Fatehgarh Club must have come into existence very soon after 
the Mutiny, for in 1865 the Club Committee sold the buildings, which 
they had erected, to a loc:il banker. The earliest arrangements were 
primitive in the extreme. The Committee had apparently exhausted its 
funds by rebuilding No. // Bungalow and the small Paul bungalow to 
contain a library. Furniture it had none. Isan Chandar Deb, the old 
Head Clerk of the Gun Carriage Agency, was given a contract to supply 
tables, chairs, and refreshments. The hard Court, just visible under the 
eucalyptus trees, appears in several old photographs taken fifty or sixty 
years ago. Tennis players did not trouble to change in those days, and 
one gentleman is wearing a bowler hat! The game chiefly played appears 



101 

*to have been badminton ; and several residents of the Town remember 
ladies playing badminton in the old racquet court in the seventies. 
There are no old records of the Club. 

The road between the Indian Military Hospital and the Park is 
named Park Lane. There was another bungalow on this road to the 
north of the old Club, which belonged to the Park, and was of course 
bought by Doctor Login. Its foundations are on the northern edge of the 
deep nullah, which cuts the Park into two. In 183*3 the occupier was 
stated to be the wife of Colonel Healy. This officer has not been 
identified. There was a quartermaster-sergeant of the Sind Nassiri 
Battalion of this name, who was buried in the Fort cemetery in the 
twenties. He left a wife and three children. In 1857 Mr. Guise, the 
Maharaja's tutor, was living in this tiny house, which from its situation 
might be called the lodge by the Maharaja's gate. Guise was an estimable 
man, specially selected by Doctor Login. When the Maharaja left 
Fatehgarh, Guise went into partnership with Maclean, who lived opposite 
in No. 2. Both Guise and his wife lost their lives in the Mutiny. They 
accompanied the Maclean family in the first flight from Fatehgarh. They 
were also friends of the American missionaries at Hak ha ; and it is 
recorded that on the 2nd June 1857 the missionaries spent their last night 
in Fatehgarh, some with Guise in this house, and others in No. J£ 
Bungalow, as Maclean had offered them accommodation in his boat along 
with the Guises and his own family. There was one other property in the 
Park called " an enclosure " belonging to Nawab Hakim Mehdi Ali Khan. 
Its use is not known, and its exact location is doubtful. Some records 
place it north of the Macklin house ; some in the middle of the nullah, 
where there are traces of a building ; others show it to coincide with No. \\ 
Bungalow. 

A few details have been brought to light about the remaining 
bungalows of Cantonments. They will be described by the numbers 
allotted to them in 1880. Before that date they bore no number at all. 
For the sake of easy identification the 1880 numbers have been given on 
the 1835 map at the end of this volume ; but it has to be understood that 
every house was known then by the name of its owner. Just before the 



102 

Mutiny a great many houses passed into the hands of a local money lender, 
named Babu Kanhaya Lai, by sale, or mortgage with possession. All his 
papers have unluckily been destroyed by tire, and except for a few stray 
documents, salvaged from the ruins of the Registrar's office after the 
Mutiny, no source of information now exists. Including three houses in 
the Park, the numbers in 1880 ran from 1 to 20 as follows : 

No. 1 Bungalow. — The only sale deed extant is one of 1826*. Charles 
Dubois sold the house to Sunder Lai. It is described as being bounded 
on the south by the wall of the Mint. Notice of the Dubois family will 
be found in chapter I. F. de Serait Dubois was an indigo planter at 
Fatehgarh in 1825. Both he and Charles Dubois must be related to 
Lieut.-Colonel Simpson Dubois (1758-1808), who helped to raise the 
Doobye-ki-paltan on 180tf at Fatehgarh. In 1857 the building was in 
use as a military hospital. It was pulled down in 1925. 

No. 2 Bungalow. — The compound was half of its present extent 
before the Mutiny, as there was another compound in its northern portion, 
belonging to Abdul Rahman, a Deputy Collector. Some time prior to 
1829 Henry Michael Hennessy purchased this house, which was then a 
Cantonment house. He signed the memorial of 1829 protesting against 
the claim of the Officer Commanding to eject civilian residents from 
Cantonments at will. He himself, however, was never disturbed, and lie 
continued to live here up to 1846, when he probably retired from his 
appointment as accountant in the Army Clothing Factory, and selling 
out to Maclean, the indigo planter, left Fatehgarh for good. The earliest 
mention of the family at Fatehgarh is in the marriage register. On the 
10th September 1827, Mary Hennessy {sic) was married to George Tuttle. 
It is thus certain that the family was established in the Station for more 
than twenty years. The only other reference to Hennessy is iu a Customs 
Department record. In 18152 he was caught trying to smuggle a boat 
load of hides from the river front. 

H. M. Hennessy had a remarkable son, who was born on the 1st 
August 1829, and most likely in this house. He was baptised at Fatehgarh 
on the 21st March 18JJ0 ; and the Dictionary of National Biography, 
therefore, is wrong in giving his place of birth as Fatehpur, for the 



163 

family was certainly at Fatehgarh during the whole of 1829 and 1830 
The Christian names of Hennessy's son, John Babonau Nickterlein, link 
him with the two Fatehgarh familes of those names. One godfather was 
thus Henry Babonau (1765-1834), the Assistant Commissary of Ordnance 
at the Fort, whose children are buried in the Kasim Bagh cemetery. An 
account of the other, John Nickterlein (indigo planter), will be found in 
chapter X. The names are spelt in various ways, not only by the records, 
but also by the bearers of the names themselves. The eminence to which 
J. B. N. Hennessy attained in after life, is evident from the words of his 

obituary notice in the Times ol the 25th May 1910 : "Hennessy On 

the 23rd inst., at his residence, Merrium, Alleyn Park, Dulwich, John 
BaboneauNickterlien Hennessey, CLE., M. A. ,F.R.S.,F.R.G.S.,F.R.A.S., 
late Deputy Superintendent, Survey of India, aged 80 years of age." The 
diversity of the spelling of Hennessy's names is striking. Captain Bullock, 
who discovered that this Hennessy of the Survey of India was connected 
with Fatehgarh, found after research that the original spelling was 
Babonau Nickterlein, which was varied in after life by Hennessy himself 
to Baboneau Nichterlein. This explanation is necessary, for the Diction- 
ary of National Biography gives the extraordinary version of Bobonau 
Nickerlieu. The surname was always written without the third " e " by 
Hennessy, senior. 

Hennessy was admitted to the junior branch of the great trigono- 
metrical survey. The notice of his life states that: " For some years 
he worked in the marshy jungles of Bengal and the North-West Provinces 
bordering the Nepal Terai. Of the party of 140 officers and assistants, 
which he joined j 40 were carried off by fever in a few days, and he was 
often incapacitated by illness. But his zeal and thoroughness attracted 
notice, and, transferred to the Punjab in 1850, he fixed the longitudinal 
position of Lahore, Amritsar efcc" He was at length promoted to the 
senior branch. The years 1863 to 1865 he spent at Jesus College, Cam- 
bridge, studying mathematics, and one of the results of his visit to 
England was the introduction of photo-zincography, rendering possible 
the rapid reproduction of maps, at survey headquarters. The following 
years were passed in survey and astronomical pursuits, and a good deal of 



1(&gt;4 

literary work was accomplished. In 1883 he was deputy surveyor-general 
and retired the next year, taking up his residence at Mussoorie for several 
years. His son, an officer in the Indian Army, was killed in action in 
Waziristan in 1900. 

No. 3 Bungalow, The old Club. See " The Park ". 

No. 4 Bungalow, See " The Park ". 

No. 5 Bungalow, Officers' Mess. See u The Park ". 

No. 6 Bungalow, Before the Mutiny this wis the residence of 
Munawwar-ud-Dowlah, or General Ahmad Ali Khan, nephew and heir of 
Nawah Hakim Mehdi Ali Khan. Mrs. Fanny Parks met him at Fatehgarh 
in 1835. He returned to Lucknow with his uncle in 1837, and never resided 
at Fatehgarh again. He was always " General " at Fatehgaih, and was 
a fine shot with both riHa and gun. East of No. 6 was a house owned 
by Babu Kanhaya Lai. Its foundations can be made out. To the south, 
and behind the servants' quarters of No. 6 was the East India Company's 
school for European children, where the young Hennessy received his 
education at the hands of James Sheppard or Shepherd. Sheppard 
married Elizabeth DeGruyther in 1829, and one of his daughters married 
Madden, whose house occupied the site of All Souls Church. Sheppard 
was succeeded by Mr. and Mrs. Shiels, or Sheels. Both were killed at 
Cawnpore in company with the Maddens in 1857. There had been a 
Conductor Moses Sheels living at Fatehgirh from 1838. It cmnot be 
said exactly whether he became schoolmaster himself, or was a relation 
of the schoolmaster. Under the management of the Shiels, the School 
achieved some renown, and many children came to it from other districts. 
The Mutiny novel, " Mariam ", a copy of which is in the Club library, 
mentions that Mariam herself was a scholar at this school, and was sent 
home to Shahjahanpur just before the outbreak of the Mutiny. Mariam 
was a Miss LeMaistre, her father being the Head Clerk of the Collector's 
office at Shahjahanpur. The book is founded on fact. The School was 
approached by a lane, running from the Strand Road to the Mall. 

No. 7 Bungalow, Robert Carshore (1767-1821. Buried in the 
Fort cemetery) bought the house in 1806 from a military officer. He was a 
wealthy cotton merchant, and did not live to see the eclipse of his family. 



105 

1837 his widow, Mary Carshore, and Joseph, his son, had to mortgage 
the house to Bibu Kanhaya Lai for Rs. 1,500. Joseph was working for 
his living as a clerk in the Collector's office. In 1880 the Opium Officer 
lived in the house. It has been completely rebuilt recently. The old 
house was a thatched bungalow of the usual type. 

A'o. 8 Bungalow. No residents of this house are known by name. 

No. 9 Bungalow. Between Nos. 7 and 9, rather near the road, was 
a house known as the Kot Master's house. The derivation of " Kot 
Master " is not certain. It has a different meaning to that of " Kot 
Sahib Captan ", or Barrack Master, for both terms occur in the same 
lists. Mt. Ashuran, described as the wife of Sir Edward Colebrooke, 
mortgaged the house to Babil Kanhaya Lai in 1830 for Rs. 2,000. The 
property, according to the deed of mortgage, comprised a thatched 
bungalow, a bottle khana, stables, and nine outhouses. In 1880 the 
occupier is recorded as the " Stamp Press Sahib ", whatever that may 
mean. No. 9 itself is an old site. Twining seems to have lived in it in 
1794, having borrowed the house from an officer on leave. Mt. Amina 
Khanum, the wife of Doctor Johnston (Civil Surgeon 181()-24), sold it to 
Babu Kanhaya Lai in 1844. Two years later it was in ruins. There 
was a small grove of twelve trees in the north-west corner by the road, 
remnants of which still exist, and the trees are shown in the 184(5 map. 
The house was rebuilt in i860 after having been destroyed in the Mutiny. 
The District Opium Officer occupied it for many years. 

A'o. 10 Bungalow. This was called the " Padre Sahib's " house 
from having been usually in the occupation of the chaplains of Fatchgarh. 
A chaplain was living in it in 1880. No old records of this house exist. 
Fronting No. 10, on the southern side of Dorset Road, was the residence 
of Doctor Lewis in 1814 Doctor Johnston followed him from 1816 to 
1824. Mt. Amina Khanum sold it to Babu Kanhaya Lai in 1842. 
Between this house and No. 12 was a thatched bungalow, also the pro- 
perty of Babu Kanhaya Lai. It occupied a situation, which almost 
corresponded with that of a house of J. G. Bruce, merchant, in 1814. 
Boundaries were very loosely described in deeds of that period, and 
Bruce's house was probably here. Bruce was in Fatehgarh in 1824. 



100 

No. 11 Bungalow. Known as the " Sahzada's House". Prince 
Muzaffar Bakht, grandson of the Emperor Shah Alam, adopted this place 
as his residence after a brief stay at the Commissariat Godown in 1819. 
He died in 1828, leaving three sons, who constructed three bungalows in 
the compound. They were small houses, and fell into the hands of 
Doctor Hunter (Civil Surgeon 1841-44), who lived in the adjoining 
house on the north. The three sons were extravagant and always in need 
of money. Muzaffar Bakht was allowed Rs. 25 daily by Government from 
1810. Each of the sons received Rs. 200 per mensem. Yavar Bakht, 
the eldest son died before 1846. Mohtesham Bakht went to Lucknow, 
and Makhdum Bakht, after losing his bungalow, went to the City. The 
descendants of Yavar Bakht and Makhdum Bakht live in the City to 
this day in great poverty. All these compounds, including that of 
Doctor Hunter, are now covered by the District Traffic Superintendent's 
residence. Between Nos. 9 and 1 1 is the house of the Executive Engi- 
neer of the B. B. &amp; C. I. Railway. It stands upon the site of a house, 
which belonged to Nawab Iqbalmand Khan of the Bangash Nawab's 
family, who was hanged for his part in the Mutiny at Fatehgarh. Natu- 
rally it came through the Mutiny unscathed. It was confiscated and put 
up to sale by Government. Bhajan Lai bought the property, and the 
house being in good condition, it was used as the Officers' Mess from 
I860 onwards. It had a large centre hall, four bed rooms, but only one 
bathroom ! 

No. 12 Bungalow. The home of the Birch family. Stephen Birch 
served under George Thomas, and under Perron in Scindia's army. In 
1803 he accepted a British pension of Rs. .300 monthly. He served under 
Lord Lake at the siege of Delhi in 1804 with a battalion of najibs from 
Panipat. He seems to have come to Fatehgarh between that date and 
1809, in which year he married Elizabeth Blake, the daughter of Robert 
Blake, the Assay Master at the Mint. She died in 1840 and was buried 
in the Fort cemetery. He died in 1844, but there is no record of his 
death beyond the year, and there is nothing to show where he was buried. 
There were three daughters, Mary Ann (married to Lieutenant John 
Baldock in 1845), Rose Maria (married to Lieutenant H. A. Reid in 



107 

1840), and Harriet, who was the object of some scandal in 1832. She 
eloped with Nawab Sarbaland Khan of the Bangash family, and became 
the second wife in his harem. She is described as a Eurasian, and her 
mother was certainly one. Mr. Shore tried the case, which her father 
instituted, but being of age she refused to return to her home, and the 
charge of abduction against the Nawab fell to the ground. She died in 
the City on the 4th January 1892, aged 81 years. From 1857 to that 
date she lived on a Government pension of Rs. 20 monthly and a little 
money which her father left her in his will. There are a number of 
letters by her iu the Mutiny records. The surviving members of the 
Bangash family, too, still preserve many letters, which show that after 
the Mutiny she made a pathetic attempt to keep up relations with the 
residents of Fatehgarh by sending presents of sweets and mangoes to the 
chief officials. She had also some relations, connected with indigo plant- 
ing, in Mainpuri District, with whom she was careful to keep on good 
terms. She had one daughter, Ashraf-un-Nissa, who in her own right 
enjoyed a pension of Rs. 10 monthly, and died, like her mother, at an 
advanced age in 191(5. Stephen Birch also had a son, .lames, who lived 
on in No. 12 Bungalow, and was a noted pigeon fancier. He does not 
occur in the Mutiny lists, and disappeared before 1857. He married 
Maria Bell in 1845. 

A r o. 13 Bungalow. Belonged to Mrs. Sarah Dyce in 1833 (see 
chapter X). The house fell into the hands of Babu Kanhaya Lai. The 
mortgage deed mentions the old bridge of 1788 as being close by. 

A'o. H Hung alow. The property of a pensioner, named Potter. 
Nothing is known about his family. A Rachel Potter was married in 
1827 to C. McCarthy. Mrs. Caroline Potter was buried in the Fort 
cemetery in 1839, The family became Eurasian, for of the two daughters, 
Harriet and Susanna, the latter always signed her name as Jamiat Bibi. 
Harriet had a miraculous escape in the Mutiny, and was one of the sur- 
vivors. In 1841 the house was bought by Sergt. -Major E. Chandler, 
pensioner. In 1850 his widow (nee Charlotte Seapage. Married 1829), 
sold it to the Revd. Gopinath Nande of the Rakha Mission. The wife of 
an Edward John Chandler was buried in the old entrenchment of Almas 



168 

Ali Khan at Mehndi Ghat, and the inscription gives the date 1855. This 
is the last mention of the Chandlers. South of No. 14 was the actual 
residence of the Potter family. The Cantonment shops cover the site. 
It WHS a small cottage, and Babu Kanhaya Lai only gave Rs. 250 
for it in 1850. 

No. 15 Bungalow. In the eighteenth century this compound marked 
the left of the Infantry Lines of the Temporary Brigade, and the Sepoy 
Guard Room was near the bridge over the nullah. George Westropp, 
trader, bought the land and erected the first house. He sold it in 1826 
to Musharraf Ali Khan, private Secretary and agent to Nawab Hakim 
Mehdi Ali Khan. His widow, Mt. Dulhan, transferred the whole pro- 
perty for Rs. 500 to Charles Cawood (son of a pensioned Sergeant. Head 
Clerk of the Clothing Agency). Cawood, his wife, and two children were 
killed at Cawnpore in 1857. He gave the house in 1847 to Mrs. Smith, 
widow ot J. Smith (merchant). Smith had bought the present Judge's 
house, and lived in it from 1855 up to his death. Mrs. Smith had no 
means, and sold the house in order to provide for herself. 

Between Nos. 15 and 16, north of Post Office Road, there is a field, 
which in 1846 contained a house belonging to Mrs. Hannah Collins. It 
was burnt down just before the Mutiny. In January 1827 Mrs. Collins 
sold the site for Rs. 650. Attached to the deed of sale is her family 
seal, bearing the date 1826. For the Collins family see chapter X. 

No. 16 Bungalow. The first Officers' Mess was set up in it. The 
date is unknown, but the Mess is mentioned as being here from 1845 to 
1857. 'The house was rented from Mrs. Hannah Collins. Major Munro, 
Lieutenants Simpson and Swetenham, and Ensign Henderson, all of the 
10th N. I . , were living in the Mess at the outbreak of the Mutiny in June 
1857. In 1880 the Barrack Master occupied it. 

No. 17 Bungalow. No. 17 together with No. 18 Bungalow formed 
one compound. The house was the residence of the Commissioner of the 
3rd Farrukhabad Division from 1829 to 1838. It was known as 
" Newnham Sahib's House ".. Newnham was perhaps the most famous of 
nil the Bengal Civilians who worked at Fatehgarh up to the Mutiny. He 
was intimately connected with the growth of the district administration, 



100 

and an account of his activities will be found in chapter XI. He was 
not only Collector of the District (1824-27), but was the first Com- 
missioner ; and he acquired this house during his time as Collector. From 
1925 to 1931 the house was the home of the Station Club. 

No. 18 Bungalow. This was not an old house. It was built after 
1860. 

No. 19 Bungalow. Between Nos. 18 and 19 is a bare field with a 
shapeless mound in the centre, which is all that remains of the house of 
the Nawabs of Farrukhabad. It was confiscated after the Mutiny, and 
falling down, was never rebuilt. A few tombs of the Nawabs' retainers 
border the lane on the north, which used to run to the Strand Koad, and 
gave access to the Company's School. No. 19 was always known as the 
" Surgeon Sahib's House ". It was the home of regimental and civil 
surgeons from the earliest times. In 1857 Doctor T. G. Heathcote, 
Surgeon to the 10th N. I . , had the house. He and his family were killed 
in the Mutiny. The house belonged to Babu Kanhaya Lai. 

No. 20 Bungalow. The name " Wright Sahib's House " was always 
given to it. W. Wright was a Bengal Civilian, who was at Fatehgarh for 
sixteen years (1810-26), as Assistant to the Judge, and as Judge. In 
this house he probably wrote his famous report on the thugs, or stranglers, 
which was interesting enough to be circulated in 1810 to all districts in 
Bengal by the Government. The compound had ten trees up to the 
Mutiny. It belonged to Nawab Hakim Mehdi Ali Khan, and for some 
reason was singled out by the mutineers for destruction. The Nawab's 
property was generally spared, and the only reason for excepting this 
house must have been that some unpopular officer lived in it. In 1859 
the Valuation Committee found the ten trees, and two walls of the house, 
standing. The property was valued at Rs. 310. 



CHAPTER VIM. 

THE CUSTOMS HOUSE. 



NEAR the junction of the Trunk and City Roads, and close to Ghatia 
Ghat, stands the classic gate house of what was the Customs 
House. Beyond a few warehouses and this gate with its guard rooms, 
little now remains. The Court House, offices, and other buildings have 
disappeared. The enclosure has only a few trees of great age and the 
vestiges of a well to show. This Customs House was first established in 
1803, and its location was then in the City on the site of the present 
Kotwali. It was a two-storeyed house with a tiled roof, and the Deputy 
Collector of Customs also lived in it. The establishment, therefore, was 
on a humble scale. It had been several years abandoned when handed 
over to the Police in 1822. The Police moved in from the Kotwali in 
Katra Ahmadganj, and rebuilt the premises in 1829. The new Customs 
House was set up in this compound by Ghatia Ghat. The actual Customs 
buildings and offices were in the centre. Lieut. Walker, the Civil 
Architect, was responsible for their erection, which was completed at a cost 
of Rs. 20,000 in July 1816. Additions were constantly being made, and 
in three years the office had become so ruinous as to necessitate the ex- 
penditure of over Rs. 6,000 upon repairing it. In 1819 a mercantile 
depot had to be constructed near the Customs House at great expense. 
This was the name given to the long ranges of sheds and godowns, which 
still remain today. Up to 1933 they were in use by the Opium Depart- 
ment. The range parallel with the western wall was known as the Cotton 
Sheds. Goods, arriving by river, had to be deposited in these warehouses 
for fifteen days; and if duty was not paid in that time, the articles were 
confiscated. Other buildings were the existing gateway and side rooms. 
The Provincial Battalion guarded the premises up to 1831, and afterwards 
burkandazes lived in the guard rooms on each side of the entrance. The 
enclosure was open to the river, the bank having been levelled to form a 
quay in 1827. 



171 

It does not require much imagination to picture the busy scenes 
which made this spot the most important gathering-place of all the local 
traders and importers during the first three decades of the nineteenth 
century. At a time when railways were not thought of, the Ganges was 
the natural highway for commerce. Farrukhabad City became a great 
emporium of trade, the value of which even by a rough estimate is 
staggering to the present day merchant of the place. Local merchants 
then dealt chiefly in gold and silver lace; copper, brass, and iron, both 
raw and manufactured ; cloth ; spices ; and borax from Hohilkhand. The 
sales of gold and silver lace were estimated at Rs. 25,000 yearly. Metal 
utensils, still one of the chief manufactures of the City, produced a trade 
worth twenty-five lakhs. The total sales of cloth are said to have fetched 
a million pounds sterling every year. Trade in wax at a period when 
candles were the best illumiuant at night, was worth Rs. 20,000 alone, 
not to speak of more valuable trade in spices and borax. The average 
estimate of the yearly value of trade at that epoch is one hundred and 
sixty lakhs of rupees yearly. Farrukhabad's position on the then frontier 
of British India, and on the Ganges, brought it to this pre-eminence. By 
1840 the position changed, and Cawnpore soon eclipsed Farrukhabad. 

An account in detail of the Customs administration will be found in 
Mr. Dewar's " Notes on the English Pre-Mutiny Records in the United 
Provinces." The Customs records relating to this District are the best 
preserved in the Provinces, and date from 1810 to 1835, in which latter 
year the local Customs was abolished in consequence of the establishment 
of a Customs line on the frontiers of Gwalioi, and a second line along 
the Jumna. They are full of details of smuggling, evasion of duty, and 
complaints by the public. The East India Company levied an ad valorem 
duty of five per cent on imports, and two and a half per cent on exports 
of all articles of trade. The duty was paid at the Customs House, and 
the trader had to obtain a rawanna, or permit. The Custom House thus 
became known in the vernacular as " Permit Ghar." On all the roads 
around the City barriers were set within a radius of four miles. No goods 
could pass beyond them until the permit was shown. There were also 
town duties levied on goods sold in the bazars. The farm of these duties 



172 

was put up to auction, and was a lucrative speculation. Transit dues 
were exacted at toll barriers in the District. The well preserved toll 
house at Khudaganj was not one of them. This house, which played a 
part in the battle at Khudaganj in 1857, was not built until the year 
1854, and was set up by the District Road Committee for levying a toll 
to be spent on the upkeep of the newly metalled road from Gursahaiganj 
to Fatchgarh. The Government retained the right to manufacture salt, 
and a duty of Rs. 2 per maund was levied on imports of it. The Collec- 
tor of Customs took five per cent commission on town dues, and one-fifth 
of the value of all confiscated articles. 

The Collector of Customs appears to have had little power to act on 
his own authority. He had to get sanction, for example, to confiscate 
three small cloths, which were found concealed under the saddle of a horse 
at the Qadri Gate in 1820. Searches appear to have been thorough. 
One person entering the City was found to have nineteen strings of coral 
in his loin-cloth ! Some bags of sweets were found to contain a few small 
pieces of lace. Four shawls were discovered among a mass of goods 
imported by Mr. T. Rutherford iu 1821. The year before Captain 
Pogson of the 24th N. I. (at Bareilly) protested at being charged Rs. 36 
on twenty-four pieces of chintz sent him by a friend. The complaint 
went up to Government, and the Collector of Customs had his explanation 
taken for overcharging. The unfortunate Captain Pogson in the end 
could not withstand the weight of officialdom ; for the Collector of 
Customs, no doubt irritated by his effrontery, found he could impose an 
additional duty of twenty percent! Captain W. R. Pogson (1787-1843) 
died at Benares. He was buried " by a roadside, according to a direction 
in his will.' 1 He compiled a history, called " The History of the 
Bundelas." His regiment is now the 3rd Bn, 7th Rajput Regiment (late 
7th D. C. 0. Rajputs). 

Names of local traders mentioned in the records are those of 
T. Rutherford, J. Jeffreys (Civil Surgeon 1825-31), J. Stewart, S. Carston, 
Mac Arthur and Moir (saltpetre refiners), Bathurst, Bush &amp; Co. (indigo 
planters at Shamsabad), J. Mercer (indigo planter at Bishengarh and 
registrar), J. C. Pyle (saltpetre refiner at Naukhanda near the Police 



173 

Lines, and John Nickterlein (importer of borax for transmission to 
Calcutta). 

The Collectors of Customs were as follows : 
1802 to 1810. A Deputy Collector 
1811. Mordaunt Ricketts. India 1802-50. Resident at Lucknow 

1822-29. 
1815. H. G. Christian. 

1814. 1 1 . Newnham. Collector 1824-27. 1st Commissioner, Farrukha- 
bad Division 1829. 

1815. A. Campbell. 

1816. R. Barlow. 

1817. W. Rennell. Buried in the Fort cemetery. 

1818. H. Newnham. 
1820. H. S. Oldfield. 
(1820-55). J. Kinloch. 

Mr. Kinloch lived in a bungalow on the northern side of the Ghatia 
Ghat Road, and next to the Customs camping ground at the cross roads. 
Ghatia Ghat itself was often called the Customs Ghat. 

The public ghat of Fntehgarh up to 1858 was Husainpur Ghat by 
the Fort. Ghatia Ghat, however, had been a recognised ferry in the 
eighteenth century ; and Sher Dil Khan, the actual builder of the Fort, 
was granted by Nawab Mohammed Khan the right to levy dues on all 
merchandise arriving at that place. The actual site of the ferry varied 
from year to year, as it does at the present day, and in 1850 the ferry 
worked generally by Naugaon village, to the south of the small bazar, 
which now bears the name of Ghatia Ghat. On the 15th January 1858 
Lord Auckland, the Governor-General passed on his way to Delhi by this 
crossing with his immense retinue; and the District Magistrate, 
Mr. Campbell, had to build a boat bridge over the Ganges and also the 
Ramganga at a cost of Rs. 1,752 to enable the Governor-General to do 
so. There is probably a mistake in the amount, which is recorded to 
have been spent, or else the bridge was made of boats borrowed 
temporarily for the purpose. Despite all the District Magistrate's 
exertions, the camp equipage of the travellers stuck fast in the sand on 



174 

the eastern bank, as the necessity for making a road had apparently been 
overlooked. The boat bridge, however, had come to stay, and bolstered 
up by continual repairs remained on up to 1844, in which year Mr. 
Gubbins constructed an entirely new one of thirty-one pontoons at a cost 
of Rs. 17,500. Each boat, or pontoon, was sixteen yards long and six 
yards broad. There was an interval of fifteen feet between each boat, 
crossed by planks. In all the bridge was S26 yards in length. It was 
made to open in the middle in order to admit of the passage of boats and 
timber for the Gun Carriage Agency. It was a public ferry, and in 1846 
the farm of the toll dues brought in Rs. 13,500. 

The boat bridge was a source of pride locally, and there is great 
correspondence in the records about it. Much ink was expended in 1849 
over an ingenious proposal of Mr. Roberts, the engineer in charge of the 
steam engine in the Fort. He proposed to construct a ferry steamer to 
work to and from across the river from the Ghat. The cost was to be 
Rs. 8,000. The steamer would consume forty maunds of wood daily at 
four maunds to the rupee. Monthly expenditure, everything included, 
was to be Rs. 350. Government turned the scheme down as being 
useless, for only for four months in the year would the river be full 
enough to float the steamer. It got as far as London, however, where the 
Company's Board of Directors thought favourably ol it. Mr. Roberts 
died in 1851. His tomb is to be seen in the Fort cemetery. Another 
attractive proposal was that of Messrs. Greenway &amp; Company, who in 
1852 gave Rs. 10,000 for the annual ferry contract. They undertook to 
maintain the bridge in order, and run trams on woodeu rails over it for 
a distance of one mile from bank to bank. The proposal was not 
accepted as being too startling for Fatehgarh. If it had come into being, 
Fatehgarh would probably have achieved the distinction of having the first 
trams in India. The arrival of a steamer at Ghatia Ghat on the 23rd 
July 1845 much stimulated the residents into forming these inventive 
ideas. 

The area containing the Customs House and Ghatia Ghat has always 
been known as Sota Bahadurpur for purposes of the Land Revenue 
Department. It was from the beginning an outlying suburb of Fatehgarh, 



175 

and had several bungalows and factories in it, of which not a trace now 
remains. The site of these habitations is exactly described in the lists of 
the 1838 Settlement of Land Revenue, and what scanty information is 
available about them is derived from these old records. Starting from the 
east of Naugaon village, a line of compounds stretched along the bank of 
the Ganges to a point, which is marked by n deep nullah a few hundred 
yards to the west of the present Ghatia Ghat bazar. The compound, 
surrounded by groves, belonged to Martin, who along with Bathurst, 
Bush &amp; Co., planted indigo at Shamsabad. It has not been discovered 
whether he lived here, or in the house in the Park, which Government 
bought for Maharaja Dhuleep Singh. The compound at the northern end 
of Naugaon was that of C. J, Coles, also an indigo planter, whose name 
occurs in the lists of residents from 1880 to 1845. One notice of this 
family is to be found in the register of marriages for 1842. On the 13th 
October Thomas Leopold Dyce married Emma Coles. The Dyces were an 
old established family, and an account of them will be found in chapter 
X. At the southern end of Naugaon was a saltpetre factory. The owner 
of it has not been recorded. To the north-west of the village was a large 
grove, which separated the Coles from the compound of a factory owner, 
whose name has not been identified. The records call him Mr. Temmel, 
and he is also described as a doctor. His bungalow overlooked the river, 
while more to the centre of his property stood the factory, which is called 
the " Machine House." Bahadurpur village, and the road to it, lay 
between this compound and the fields rented by the Customs Department 
up to 1856 ; for long after the abolition of the Customs in 1835, the 
Collector of the District had an establishment here, which supervised the 
distribution of salt, refining of saltpetre, and the prevention of salt 
smuggling from the kingdom of Oudh. The large enclosure of the 
Customs, with sheds and office, came next. At the present day the 
western wall of the enclosure bounds the Trunk Road to the ferry at the 
river, a road which is lined by shops, and usually leading to the boat 
bridge. A revenue map of 1844, however, does not show any road or 
ferry at this spot, and the question arises as to where the ferry and the 
boat bridge could then have been. The only ferry shown is that at the 



170 

end of a broad road along the western boundary of the compound of 
Mr. Coles. This road was a much frequented one, as is evident from its 
width on the plan. It started from the main road in Naugaon village, 
and it is usual for shops and buildings to line the road as near as possible 
to these ferries in order to benefit from the traffic over them. Naugaon 
village, which was originally a compact area to the south, stretched itself 
along the Trunk Road with this design. It can reasonably be presumed 
that the public ferry and boat bridge from 1838 for many years was at 
the eastern end of this side road. 

Two compounds immediately adjoined the Customs House. On t he 
bank of the river was a house owned by Mr. Clark. He had also a pro- 
perty in the Circular Road, and another on the site of the Maude Lines, 
where it is certain lie actually resided himself. Earlier records than that 
of 1844 indicate that Mr. Kinloch, the Collector of Customs, lived next 
door to the Customs House, and he must have resided in this compound, 
which has now disappeared, giving place to the Ghatia Ghat Bazar. Some 
difficulty arises over the compound to the west along the edge of the City 
Road. It is called the Customs House Gate, and two tall pillars of brick 
still stand in battered condition to mark the place. There were so many 
extensions to the Customs House property and buildings erected that it is 
impossible to identify the use of this compound ; but at this spot is 
also to be found the camping ground of the Customs, of which there are 
several mentions. The area to the west was covered by the property of 
Mr. James Mercer (1788-185J5) and the fields, which he rented from Dan 
Kuer. A tine well by the side of the City Road, which he built, is still 
called ' Mercer Sahib's well '\ He was buried in the Fort cemetery. A 
few outhouses and foundations near the river bank are all that remain of 
his house. His son left Fatehgarh just before the Mutiny, and died 
intestate. The property was sold iu 1859 at Calcutta by the Adminis- 
trator-General of Bengal. Jt now belongs to Babu Gendan Lai, Vakil. 

Mr. Deano (Commissioner for the Ceded Provinces) had a garden 
nearly opposite to the Customs House, being attached to the small hamlet, 
of Bhagua Nagla. The original Bhagua was a Chumar syce, to whom the 
land was granted in the eighteenth century by the Bangash Nawab. By 



177 

1812 the property had fallen into the hands of Mr. Deane, who started a 
fruit garden adjoining the village. On Mr. Deane's death in 1818, Govern- 
ment granted the village to his colleague on the Board of Commissioners 
for the Ceded Provinces, Sir Edward Colebrooke, and to the Board's 
Secretary, Mr. Newnham. The area was fifty acres, and Mr. Newnham, 
buying out his partner for Rs. 2.000, sold it in 1829 to the Bangash 
Nawab Sarbuland Khan for Rs. 5,000, who, it will be remembered, eloped 
with Miss Harriet Birch. The village is now just outside the Cantonment 
boundary, and is no longer noted for its fruit. At the beginning of the 
nineteenth century strawberries and peaches were produced all over the 
Station. 



CHAPTER IX. 

THE OLD CHURCH. 



A PICTURESQUE landmark Is the spire of the old Church, which 
overlooks the parade ground. This end of the Station was out- 
side Cantonments, and here was located the business centre of Fatehgarh. 
Thickly crowded with small thatched bungalows, the area around the 
Church must have presented a thriving appearance with its shops and 
tent godowns in the Circular Road, and the theatre by the side of the 
parade ground ; while from 1840 onwards the racquet court was in daily 
use. 

In spite of the largeness of the Fatehgarh community, there was no 
church up to 1821, a curious feature considering the ample provision for 
worship, which was made in other old Cantonments. The Temporary 
Brigade had its own chaplain ; for in January, 1779, the Revd. T. Ford 
was sent to act in that capacity. At no time previous to the year 1818, 
however, is there any mention of a church, and it cannot be said where 
divine worship was celebrated. It is most probable that a private 
bungalow was utilised for the purpose, since this was certainly the case in 
several other stations. Even in the large Cantonment of Cawnpore a 
single-roomed bungalow was considered to be ample for church services 
for the first forty years of its existence. It was the visit of the Marquis 
of Hastings in 1815 which gave impetus to a project for building a church 
at Fatehgarh. The Marquis had remarked on the difficulty of holding 
Services, and during his stay they were conducted in one of the rooms 
of the theatre, Mr. Henderson, the Cawnpore Chaplain, having been 
summoned for the purpose. 

The erection of a church was sanctioned by Government on the 
4th March 1818. The Agent to the Governor-General wrote on the 
5th January 1819, reporting the election of a select Vestry, and the 
purchase of a plot of ground for Rs. 1,500. Building operations, how- 
ever, were very slow. In 1819 the Revd. J. P. Hastings came from 



179 

Cawnpore as chaplain, the first after an interval of nine years, and work 
was speeded up in spite of protests by the Superintendent of Public 
Buildings that the ground was defective. Thirteen glazed windows were 
sanctioned in October of that year, and on the 15th November 1821, the 
building was at length completed. The completion reports and accounts 
were prepared on the 18th January 1822, the total expenditure being 
Rs. 20,700. Government at Calcutta passed the accounts, sanctioning 
the following staff of two bearers on four sonat rupees per mensem for 
dusting the pulpit, reading desk and seats, one chokidar, and one sweeper 
at the same rate of pay. Captain Casement, the District Barrack Master, 
furnished the interior for 702-13-5 sonat rupees. Four officers were 
responsible for the building from start to finish. Captain T. Burn, 
Superintendent of Public Buildings, was the first, and after preparing 
plans he handed over charge to Captain W. H. Kemm, (1783-1859), who 
ended his career subsequently as a Lieutenant-General. The third 
architect was a certain Captain Roberts, who appears to have been res- 
ponsible for the actual building from 1819 to 1821. This Captain 
Roberts, then an Assistant Superintendent of Civil Buildings, had a 
distinguished career. He was the General Sir Abraham Roberts (1784?- 
187B), who made a name in the 1st Afghan War, and was the father of 
Field-Marshal Lord Roberts. He died at Clifton at an advanced age 
Of Captains Burn and Casement nothing is known. The Church was 
built in the style then popularly known as the "Grecian", and seems to 
have been a square box-like building with side aisles. There was a 
pyramidal tower and a spire very much like those of the Rakha church, 
and the whole building at Rakha may well have been a copy. The west 
end with one bay of the nave is all that remains to-day, and is used as 
the Civil Surgeon's Office in connection with the Civil Hospital. Traces 
of the old wall decorations can be seen in places beneath the modern 
whitewash. The ruin of the Church is due to the mutineers of the 
41st N. I . , who in 1857 exploded two mines beneath it, and destroyed 
all but the west end and tower. After the Mutiny the Church was for 
several years a heap of ruins, and the large compound desolate. The new 
Church of All Souls was to be built by the old rifle range; and for six 



180 

years the site was left as it was. In 1863 the compound was cleared of 
rubbish. The west end was put in order, and turned into a school. In 
1870 the new Civil Hospital was established a few yards away through 
the efforts of Doctor Reid, the Civil Surgeon, and the school was moved 
to make way for hospital needs. For many years the remnants of the 
Church served the purpose of hospital wards, until proper accommodation 
being provided in new buildings in the compound, they were turned to 
their present use as offices for the Civil Surgeon. 

The old Church is nowhere styled " church " in the records. From 
the beginning the residents were much perplexed as to whether the 
edifice was a church, or a chapel, and also whether it was a church 
erected by Government, or a chapel made by the residents. In April 
1820, while building operations were still going on, Mr. Ross, the Agent 
to the Governor-General at Fatehgarh, forwarded a petition to the 
Governor-General at Calcutta, desiring a ruling on the point, and 
enquiring if the Bishop could be asked for a license to celebrate public 
worship in the building, until it was consecrated. The Governor-General 
in reply stated that the building was to be called a chapel erected by 
Ciovernnient, and aided by the contributions of the community of 
Fatehgarh. As early as 1817 Sir Edward Colebrookc started collecting 
money, and that year he reported that he had received 4,000 sicca rupees 
in subscriptions for the " new chapel ". The license was issued by the 
Bishop of Calcutta on the Lith June 1820 "for the performance of 
Divine Service iu the newly built Church or Chapel at Fattygarh before 
consecration"' The Bishop seems to have shared the doubts of the 
congregation as to the right title of the building. The Church was 
consecrated under the name of Christ Church on the 7th January 1837. 
A record of this consecration was discovered by Bishop Saunders, the 
present Bishop of Luc know, in a book called " The Life of Bishop 
Daniel Wilson " (Bishop of Calcutta 1838-58), and he has kindly sent 
the following extract from it. " Another rapid run of forty-eight hours 
through Furreedpore and Futtehgunge (both in Bareilly District) to 
Jellalabad (in Shahjahanpur District) on January 5th, followed by 
another of equal distance, varied by a passage across the mighty 



181 

Ganges on January 6th, brought the Bishop safely to Futtyghur, where 
he found au excellent chaplain (Rev. R. Ewing), a good Church, and 
all things in order. Much pleasant intercourse took place here with 
friends, who were gradually passing down the country from Sitnlali, the 
germs of missionary work were watched and encouraged. The Church 
and burial grounds were consecrated. Divine services were performed. 
The Holy Sacrament and Confirmation administered; and then the Bishop 
rejoined the camp for a few days quiet march. The sportsmen went out, 
and provided the table with wild geese, as on the other side of India it 
had been provided with wild peacocks. On January 14th the Bishop 
entered the large station of Cawnpore, and rested in the Chaplain's 
house ". Bishop Heber in his celebrated tour of Upper Bengal came 
very near to visiting Fatehgarh. He was actually invited to do so by 
Nawab Hakim Mehdi Ali Khan. He enquired about the Church, 
however, and wrote to the Governor-General in 1825 that " Fatehgarh 
has an elegant and spacious church, and a numerous Christian population, 
but no chaplain. Should one be allowed, which is on every account 
very desireable, he might with great advantage attend one Sunday in 
the month, alternately at Coel (Aligarh) and Mynpooree ", Govern- 
ment recognised the expediency of selecting Fatehgarh as a station for 
a chaplain permanently. There had been no chaplain since the Rcvd. 
J. P. Hastings left in 1820 after the death of his young wife, who was 
buried in the Fort cemetery, and henceforth chaplains were sent to Fateh- 
garh regularly. 

There had been chaplains on and off from the very first years of the 
Temjwrary Brigade, but in the absence of regular mention in the 
records, it cannot be said if they succeeded one another without a 
break. The Station Staff Officer certainly officiated, when the chaplain 
was away, and curiously this officer had also to work as postmaster, 
when required. The following list contains the names of all chaplains 
mentioned in the records : 
1779. Revd. T. Ford. He came in January and seems to have been the 

first. 
1793. Revd. Tho. Clarke. 



182 

1794. Revd. Paul Lemerick. Revd. W. Lewis. 

1795-96 Revd. Tho. Clarke. 

1805. Revd. T. Hartwell. 

180(:&gt;. Revd. H. Shepherd. 

1807. Revd. H. P. Stacy, L. L. 1). Died on the 7th November, and 
was buried in the Fort cemetery. 

1808-09. Revd. R. Jeffreys. Mrs. Jeffreys died in 1809. The epitaph 
on her tomb in the Fort cemetery is long and quaint. 

1810-12. The Station Staff Officer (Lieutenant P. H. Ashurst) . 

1813. Revd. S. S. Coleman. 

1815. The Marquis of Hastings brought the Cawnpore Chaplain to 
Fatehgarh for five months. 

1819. On the building of the Church being started, the Revd. J. P. 
Hastings was transferred from Cawnpore to be the first perma- 
nent chaplain, but on the death of his wife in 1820 he obtained 
an appointment at Calcutta. 

1825. Revd. J. Irving. He went on furlough in 1831. 

1833. Revd. R. Ewing. 

1838. Revd. W. Sturrock. 

1839. Revd. J. H. A. Rudd. 
1845. Revd. H. P. Brooks. 

— Revd. R. B. Malltry. 

1849. Revd. J. Carshore. 

1850. Revd. W. J. Jay. Baptised Maharaja Dhuleep Singh in 1852. 
1857. Revd. N. Fisher. Killed at Cawnpore in the Mutiny. His tragic 

story has been told in " Fatehgarh and the Mutiny ". 
The Station Staff Officer celebrated marriages as well as taking the 
burial services. The earliest entries of marriages at Fatehgarh in the 
registers of St. John's Church at Calcutta, then the Parish Church of 
Bengal, are as follows : 
1786. June 3rd. James Wilkinson, Mary Somkyns. Married by D. 

Mackinnon, Lt. of Artillery. 
1787 March 21st. George Hardeman, Gustruy De Miller. By D. 

Mackinnon, Lt. of Artillery. 



183 

1787 April 8th. Edward Suffolks, Ann Botterell. By John Gordon, Lt. 
„ Sept. 10th. George Thorp, (fifer) , Hannah De Rozi. Hy John 

Gordon, Lt. 
„ Sept. 13th. Joseph Gascoyne, Miss Sarah Evance. By John 

Gordon, Lt. 
„ Oct. 7th, Joseph Silvia, Elizabeth De Razera. By John Gordon, 
Lt. 
1793. April 7th. William Doyle, Mary Domingo. By Revd. Tho. 
Clarke. 
„ Sept. 15th. John Richardson, Lt., Jane Lou is'm Debonacrind. By 
Revd. Tho. Clarke. 
The rites of baptism, however, were not performed by the Station 
StafiF Officer, when the chaplain was away. Children were baptised at any 
age, whenever a chaplain happened to come to the Station. The register 
of 1795 indicates this clearly, as the following extract will show : 
1795. March 13th. George Stewart, aged IS months. S/o. George Dick, 
Lt., by Rev. Thomas Clarke. 
„ March 13th. Frances Ann, aged 2 years 4 mos. D/o. George 

Dick, Lt., by Rev. Thomas Clarke. 
„ March 13th. Ann Elizabeth, aged 12 months. D/o. William 

Cress well, Lt., deceased, by Rev. Thomas Clarke. 
„ March 15th. Charles, aged 12 months. S/o. Charles Campbell 

Fifer, 18 Bn., by Rev. Thomas Clarke. 
„ March 15th. William, aged 4 months 2 days. S/o. William 

Lawrence, Matross, by Rev. Thomas Clarke. 
„ March 22nd. William, aged 13 months. S/o. John Jarrot, Provost 
Sergt, by Rev. Thomas Clarke. 
Most of the entries relate to families of which nothing is known but 
their name. The following entry, however, is of interest: 
1793. 7th March. Charlotte Morgan, aged 9 weeks. D/o. Richard 
Ramsay, Capt, of Cavalry, and Mary, his wife, by Rev. Tho. 
Clarke. 

Captain Ramsay, of course, was the officer, who deserted after the 
battle of Bitaurah in 1794. His wife was Samuel Skardon's daughter. 



184 

The then Officer Commanding, Colonel Charles Morgan, may have 
stood as sponsor, hence the name Morgan. 
After 1816 registration of baptisms, marriages, find burials were made 
more frequently, and the registers containing them still exist in the custody 
of the Diocesan Registrar at Calcutta. Notice of burials will be found in 
chapter V. Another kind of- record was involved in the destruction of 
the old Church. There were many tablets on its walls, only one of which 
is known. The inscription was as follows : 

4&lt; Died at Futteeghur on the 26th April 1848 Louisa, the beloved 
wife of Wm. Bannatyne Macleod, who served for 14 years as surgeon 
of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry. Her gentle and amiable disposition 
so endeared her to the officers of the Regiment that they have erected 
this tablet to her memory as a token of their affection." 
Mrs. Macleod was buried in the Fort cemetery. The list of baptisms 
after 1816* contains nothing of special interest, but it is otherwise in the 
case of marriages, ninety-three of which were celebrated in this Church 
between 1826 and 1857. The first to take place were those of two 
sisters. On the 26th .lune 1826 Martha Ann Faithful was nmm'ed to 
Tho. R. Tell, and on the 20th July following Maria Faithful to John 
Bean. The last marriage was that of James Durand, the tent manufac- 
turer in the Circular Road, and Hannah Halliday on the 23rd August 
1856. Four members of the Brierley family, residing within a stone's 
throw of the Church itself, and three of the Birch family in No. 12 
Bungalow find place in the list. Mary Ann and Rose Maria, the two 
sisters of Harriet Birch, who eloped with a Bangash Nawab, married army 
officers. Familiar names, belonging to families long resident in the 
Station, are Churcher, Maxwell, Bickers, Cawood, Dyce, Collins, Kembali, 
Hennessey, DetJruyther, and Jennings. Janet Jennings, married to John 
Collins in 1844, met a cruel death in the Mutiny. The Mutiny, too. is 
recalled by the entry of John Ahern's marriage with Lucy Lambert in 
1850. A hern fell in the defence of the Fort, and was buried in the 
cemetery there. It was Mrs. A hern, who proved herself an excellent rifle 
shot on the walls. John Kew, the Postmaster, who fell in the parade 
ground massacre, is in the register; and his sister Arabella married the 



185 

Inspector of Post Offices, William Catania, only ten months before they 
both perished at Cawnpore. Other Mutiny victims, such as Madden, in 
whose compound the new Church now stands, the Shepherds, Ives, 
Gaumisse, Gibson, Macklin, and George Davy Raikes (killed at Bareilly. 
Judge of Farrukhabad 1850) have their names recorded in it. Two well 
known families of the United Provinces find mention in an entry for the 
18th May 18539, showing the marriage of J. R. LeMaistre and Mary 
Fanthome. The bridegroom was a descendant of J. LeMaistre, a Puisne 
Judge of Calcutta in Warren Hastings' time ; while the bride was a 
daughter of Captain Bernard Fanthome (died at Bareilly 1845), a French 
adventurer, who served in Scindia's army, and then joined Lord Lake. 
An account of this family will be found in Blunt's " Christian Tombs and 
Monuments. 1 ' Another entry relates to Major Charles Bruere, who was 
shot on the roof of the Brigade Mess during the defence of the Residency 
at Lucknow. A society marriage took place in February 18*31, which 
must have been celebrated with much ceremony. Eliza, the daughter of 
Brigadier C. S. Fagan, commanding Rohilkhand, was in that month 
married to Major-General J. W. Sleigh, C. B. Fatehgarh was chosen for 
this marriage, since Brigadier Fagan had been connected with the place 
as Army Clothing Agent for many years. On the 21st January 1842 
Captain Hatcheli of the 69th N. I. was married to Frances Anne Graham. 
Captain Hatcheli died two years after, but his widow survived him until 
1894, and was probably the last to have been intimately connected with 
the old Church. 

The permanent residents of the Station became closely connected to 
each other by marriage. To take one example, there was a group of 
seven families, who intermarried between 1830 and 1850. W. H. 
DeGruyther, the Deputy Collector, married Mary Ann Bickers, whose 
sister, Sarah, was afterwards united to Charles Cawood, Head Clerk of the 
Clothing Agency. DeGruyther's two sisters both married local residents. 
Sophia Jane married E. Jennings, whose sister, Janet, became the wife of 
J. R. Collins, the son of another Deputy Collector. The other sister, 
Elizabeth, married James Shepherd, the schoolmaster ; and Mrs. Madden, 
the wife of J. R. Madden of the Clothing Agency, was Elizabeth 



186 

Shepherd. Four of these families were murdered in the Mutiny. Besides 
this group it would be possible to form several others of the kind, notably 
of indigo planter families like that of the Churchers, or of families devo- 
ted to office work in humble grades like those of the Gaumisses, Anthonys, 
and Da Silvas. 



CHAPTER X. 

THE CIVIL LINES. 



THE name "Civil Lines' 1 was applied to the row of houses on the 

1 Ganges bank, reaching from Bargadia Ghat to the present Golf 
Links. Overlooking the temple by the seventh brown on the Links was the 
house of Mr. Robinson. Traces of the well can be seen, but the house it- 
self has gone. It was called after John Bush. The first Bush was Thomas, 
who came in 1780, and set up as a merchant first by himself, and then 
in 1791 as partner with Robert Bathurst. The association disappears 
in 1813, when the Bushes joined Urquhart and Co. ; and John Bush, the 
son, later became an indigo planter at Mehndi Ghat near Kanauj with 
Packard &amp; Co. He is last recorded in 1846. The house continued to 
be called "John Boos's" house. Mr. Robinson, who elected to live in 
Bush's house, was the Francis Horsley Robinson of Barhpur fame (see 
chapter VI). He was Collector from 1835 to 1837, acting as Commis- 
sioner of the Agra Division five years later. He died in 1856 after 
serving as Member of the Board of Revenue. Nawab Dooleh records in 
his diary that he used to call on Mr. Robinson at this house. Between 
this bungalow and the present Collector's house was a bungalow called 
the "Colonel Sahib's house" up to 1850. Many Commanding Officers 
lived here, although it could never have been a very large residence. 
The memorial of the civilians living in Cantonments included as one of 
their grievances the complaint that in 1829 the Officer Commanding and 
several other military officers would not reside anywhere but in the Civil 
Lines. Both these compounds were amalgamated into one by David 
Churcher after the Mutiuy. David Churcher's father, Thomas Churcher. 
had lived in the house, the place of which is now taken by the Officers 1 
Mess. In 1850 the family moved to a house in Kutra, behind the 
present Police Lines. Thomas Churcher went to Etah District, being 
interested in an indigo plantation there, but his two sons remained at 
Fatehgarh, and supervised an indigo factory at Chilauli, near Kaimganj. 



188 

The house at Kutra fell into ruins during the Mutiny. T. H. Churcher 
was killed. His brother David, however, was one of the seven sur- 
vivors of the Mutiny at Fatehgarh. The two old bungalows of John 
Bush and the "Colonel Sahib 91 were bought and demolished by him. The 
present house was erected on a fresh site, and in it David Churcher died 
in 1908. He was given the honours of a military funeral in the new 
cemetery, where his tomb is to be seen. By the well on the Ganges bank 
are the foundations of a small building in which were some indigo vats. 
After the failure of indigo Chunni Lai, Mr. Churcher's Jemadar, lived 
in it. Chunni Lai had helped Mr. Churcher to escape in the Mutiny 
from the Kutra house to the neighbouring village of Mahrupur. 

The house of the Collector and Magistrate was called the "Residenti." 
The tradition is that on, or near this site, was the habitation of the early 
Residents ; and after them came wealthy indigo planteis. The massive 
chenam columns and Corinthian capitals in the hall resemble the archi- 
tecture affected by Nawab Hakim Mchdi Ali Khan, into whose possession 
the property came in 1824. The house, as it stands, was built by him 
about 1825, and was thereafter called by his name. He left it to one of 
his nephews in 18137, named Munawwar-ud-Dowleh. 

From 1835 to 1852 the Judge and Magistrate resided here ; for he 
also took over the rather ornamental duties of Agent to the Governor- 
General, and it was the custom for the Agent to live in the " Residenti." 
Henry Swetenham was the first. Having entered the service in 1810, he 
first appears in Fatehgarh as an Acting Collector in 1820, and the follow- 
ing year he took over charge for a further two years. During this 
period he lived at Kasim Bagh, just a few yards behind the Maude Lines, 
where the first Collectors appear to have lived. In 1832 he officiated as 
Commissioner, and in 1835 commenced his six years tenure of the Judge's 
office. 

Mrs. Fanny Parks stayed in this house four times between 1835 and 
1839 with Henry Swetenham, who was a relation of hers. In the 
"Wanderings of a' Pilgrim" she informs us that the family belonged to 
Somerford Booths in Cheshire, the seat of Captain Clement Swetenham, 
16th Light Dragoons, a veteran of the Peninsula and Waterloo. Another 



180 

Captain Swetenham was in the Sappers at Meerut, and Mrs. Parks 
superintended for him the building of Cloud End at Mussoorie. The 
garden at Fatehgarh is described as being well planted with a profusion 
of rare trees and shrubs. The house was cool in April with tatties and 
thermantidotes in full blast. 

Nawab Dooleh, the local Pepys, records his calls on Mr. Swetenham 
in-great detail. " Salteen Sahib ", as he was called, received his visitors 
at 11 a. m., and after conversation cardamoms were presented on a 
silver tray. The visitor then gave his gift of ceremony and took leave. 
Nawab Dooleh in May 1839 brought a dali of rose water, Akbarabad 
oranges, as the Agra variety was then called, and pomegranates. On 
this occasion he narrowly missed Mrs. Parks, who had just left. Mr. 
Swetenham retained the customs of a past generation. He was the last 
officer to smoke his huqqa in court, and go about accompanied by a 
huqqa bardar, carrying the necessary apparatus. The huqqa was then 
fast going out of fashion. He died in 1860. 

Messrs. Cartwright and Tyler and other Judges up to 1852 lived 
here. Mr. Tyler, 1841-45, was the last Agent. In 1852, Nawab Dooleh 
saw Mr. Buller, the new Judge, living in tents behind the Judge's Court, 
lief ore moving into the present Judge's house. The reason for this 
migration is not known. 

In 1861, Mr. Walker, a Deputy Collector, bought the premises at an 
auction for Rs. 2,000, Munawwar-ud-Dowleh having relinquished all his 
uncle's property to Government. The house had to be renovated after 
the damage incurred in the Mutiny, and the bazar tradition is that the 
roof fell leaving the chenam pillars standing. The records show that 
not a door post or beam or woodwork of any kind had been left in it. 
Mr. Walker was transferred to Jaunpur, and gave the property to his 
wife, Ajabi Begum. Nawab Jaffri Begum of Shamsabad, the wife of 
Nawab Dooleh, held a mortgage over it, and in 1869 she acquired the 
full title from Ajabi Begum, along with a shop outside the gate, the 
foundations of which can be traced by the roadside. 

In 1872, the Settlement Officer took possession, and erected his 
office in the compound near the Toll House. After the end of Settlement 



190 

in 1876', the garden was abandoned, and for 12 years appeal's to have 
formed an impenetrable jungle. Its rescue was due to Mr. Growse, who 
in 1888 bought the property, together with Baqirganj on the other side 
of the main road, for Rs. 11,000, and repairing the house itself, 
embellished it with frescoes by Jaipur artists and iron grilles, which he 
took away with him on retirement. Much of his decoration, however, 
still remains, and it is to be regretted that painted punkha boards and 
poles, long objects of admiration, have perished. 

On the western side of the road overlooking Baqirganj is a large 
bungalow, which was the town house of Nawab Jaffri Begum: and 
from this place her husband Nawab Dooleh made his periodical calls on 
the notables of Fatehgarh. It was generally occupied by European 
Deputy Collectors, of whom the best known was William DeGruyther, 
He makes his first appearance in 1836 as an Assistant in the Army 
Clothing Factory hard by; but before this he had been living in 
Cantonments and signed the memorial of 1829. On the 22nd February 
1838 he was appointed Deputy Collector under Regulation IX of 1833, 
and he was pi'esent in 1855. The Mutiny lists however do not mention 
him ; and beyond the fact that he was interested in potato cultivation, 
and in 183(5 his sister married Mr. Kdmond Jennings, a merchant, 
nothing further is known. 

North of this house is now the Government High School; but 
up to 1844 the property was the residence of A. Jacob, a Eurasian clerk 
in the Collector's office. The property consisted of bungalow, outhouses 
and a zenana, and only fetched Rs. 900 in 1844, when Mr. Richard 
Rowe bought it. J. W. Jacob, a brother, was better known, and had 
shops both at Agra and Fatehgarh. Occasionally, he took the farm of 
the Town duties from the Customs Department, and in 1816' lived where 
the Maude Lines are situated. 

A road divided this compound, as it does now, from the area 
occupied by the Army Clothing Factory, which nearly covered the 
extent of the Company Garden. Roughly speaking, the Club tennis 
courts cover the site of the Army Clothing Factory, or Kurti godown, 
as it was styled locally. Between the tennis courts and the walls of the 



191 

serai, was Mrs. Hannah Collins* bungalow, with Mrs. Jennings' house to 
the south of it. The Army Clothing Agent lived next door to the 
Factory, his gate being nearly opposite the Police Superintendent's 
present entrance. His compound extended up to the houses of the 
Sadder Bazar and the house of Alfred Hinc. North-west was the Rum 
Godown, or Commissariat, and here was a bakery. The site is now covered 
by the Gracey Club. 

This portion of the Civil Lines was inhabited before 1816. The 
Agent's bungalow, and the one behind Mrs. Collin's, were iu that year 
bought by Sheikh Madari from a Mr. Heysham, the old serai being 
known also as Hey sham's Serai. The Agents at first rented their house 
from Sheikh Madari. Iu 184*1, however, the Agent, Major Simmonds, 
bought it outright for Rs. 2,400. 

The Collins family had long been in Fatehgarh, and W. Collins, 
Deputy Collector, died here in 1831. His son J. R. Collins was also a 
Deputy Collector and died in 1855. Mrs. Hannah Collins (wife of 
J. R. Collins) wns left well off. Between No. 15 and 16 Bungalows in 
Cantonments, now a bare field, was a house of hers. She owned No. Ki, 
the old Officers' Mess, and the fine house on the Ganges bank, formerly 
inhabited by the Opium Agent. She herself lived in a small house 
between the Club tennis courts and the serai, and here she met her death 
in the Mutiny. The ruins were sold in 1861 by Mr. J. A. Collins of 
Delhi for Rs. 410 to Pt. Ganga Rain. In 18(j3 the site was absorbed in 
the Company Garden. 

A Government Order of the Vice-President in Council, dated the 5th 
December 1809 directed that the clothing of the Army was to be 
arranged for by an Agent and a Deputy Agent to be stationed at 
Fatehgarh. This was enforced by au Order of the Governor-General, 
dated the 3rd December 1811. Accordingly after 1812 the following 
Agents had charge of the Clothing Agency at Fatehgarh : — 

1. 1813-24. Major C. S. Fagan, (1781-1843). Afterwards 
Major-General and C. B. In 1815 and 1825 he raised new battalions, 
the former of which, the l/29th (57th N. I.), received its colours on 
the parade ground in 1815 at the hands of Lord Moira, then 



192 

visiting Fatehgarh as Governor-General. It therefore adopted the 
same uniform as that of Lord Moira's old British regiment, the 27th 
Foot, and was known as " Moira ki paltan." The regiment mutinied 
at Ferozepore in 1857. Major Fagan is also stated to have raised a 
third battalion at Fatehgarh in 1818, which still exists ns the 9th 
Gurkha Rifles. Major T. P. Smith, however, commanded it from the 
lieginning, and is also credited with the work of raising it. In 1825 
Major Fagan was Officer Commanding at Fatehgarh. The next year 
he commanded the 6th Infantry Brigade at the siege of Bhurtpore. 
He was Brigadier Commanding Rohilkhand in 1831, and that same 
year he came to Fatehgarh to witness the marriage of his daughter to 
General Sleigh in the old Church. 

2. 1824-25. Major F. Sackville, (1785-1827), 55th N. I. 
Afterwards Lt. -Colonel 41st N. I. Arrived in India 1801. 2nd 
Mahratta War and operations in Bundelkhand. Employed a great 
deal on survey work, and in 1817-18 was A, Q. M. G. at the head of 
the topographical staff in Bengal. In 1819-20 he was 1). Q. M. G. 
Bengal, Died at Richmond, Surrey. 

3. 1825-32. Major J. Wilkie, (1786-1845), 8th N. I. Arrived 
in India 1805. Retired 1832 from Fatehgarh. Operations against 
Dundia Khan 1807, Served with Pioneers 1812-25. Nepal War 
1814-15. 1st Burma War, Arakan 1825. Transferred to 8th N. I. 
1824. 

4. 1832-36. Major R. B. Fulton. Bengal Artillery. Died at

In this small area great activity in making army uniforms is 
manifested by the records, which refer to quarrels with the Customs over 
detaining bales of cloth. The compound was much hemmed in by the 
bazar, and the buildings being thatched, there was obvious danger for the 
stores of cloth. In 1852, Colonel Tucker wrote to Mr. Cunninghame, 
the Magistrate, that a fire balloon had fallen on the thatch of his house, 
and the noise of fireworks in the bazar kept him awake all night. "I 
trust", he says, "without infringing on the legitimate amusements of 
individuals you will be able to check those which are so fraught with dan- 
ger to the public." The necessary prohibition was issued. 

The Mutiny lists show that the personnel under Colonel Tucker 
included Messrs. Ahern, Anderson, Cawood, Finlay and Madden. Colo- 
nel Tucker and Ahern were killed in the Fort; Anderson in the 
boat at Manpur Katri; and the others at Cawnpore. Anderson and 
Charles Cawood came here in 1836- In 1840, Cawood married Sarah, 
the daughter of Sergt. Major Bickers, and they lived in No. 15 
Bungalow. Madden's house was on the site of All Souh Church on the 
parade ground. 

The Post Office Road bisects an area, seamed by nullahs, between 
Strand Road on the east and Machli Tola on the west. Before the 
Mutiny the road did not exist; but where are now bare fields, the quarters 
of the Post Office Superintendent, and the outlying houses of Machli 
Tola, twelve small compounds, each with its bungalow, were to be seen. 
One small thatched house at the cross roads, formerly the home of the 
European Reserve Inspectors of Police, indicates the general appearance 
of these residences. At the northern end of Machli Tola was the house 
of John Nickterlein, which has been divided into two separate halves. 
A portion has been rebuilt; but the half which contains Hashim's furni- 
ture shop, is in its original condition. 



194 

John Nickterlein, merchant, appears in the records of the year 1819 
as an importer of borax from Nepal, upon a consignment of which he was 
overcharged duty by the Customs. In 1820 he lost a rawanna, or permit, 
and the Customs office addressed him as Mr. Necterlein. His name was 
properly Nichteriein, though he himself never seems to have spelt it in 
that way. In 1833 he applied unsuccessfully for appointment as principal 
Sudder Amin, or bailiff, and was passed over for James Mercer. He 
appears also to have resided in Cantonments, for in 1829 he signed the 
memorial protesting against the right of military officers to eject civilians. 
He was a friend of Hennessy, the Clothing Factory accountant, and was 
godfather of Hennessy's famous son. The last mention of him at 
Fatehgarh is in 1846. The murder of his son (S. A. Nichteriein) at 
Sawamai in Aligarh District during the Mutiny indicates that he had 
moved from Fatehgarh before 1857, and started an indigo factory at 
Mandrak. 

The Cantonment boundary, then as now, ran conterminous with 
the main nullah of Bargadia Ghat, and within the bend to the north- 
west of the Post Office Superintendent's house was the residence of 
Mrs. Sarah Dyce in 1835. The site is now under cultivation, but the 
well is left. This lady also owned No. 13 Bungalow on the Strand Road. 
The family had long been resident in Fatehgarh. Thomas Leopold 
Dyce, her husband, was probably related to the Colonel G. A. Dyce of 
the Begum Samru's service. In 1816 he was granted the farm of the 
Town duties of Farrukhabad, In 1817 he was appointed Registrar in 
the office of the Board of Commissioners for the Ceded Provinces, and he 
signed the 1829 memorial against the Cantonment Authority. He was 
a co-sharer of the village of Bahorikpur in pargana Bhojpur. Mrs. Sarah 
Dyce's family was no less interesting. She was the daughter of Mostyn 
Jones merchant, of Cawnpore, and was born in 1786. Her sister, Anne, 
married at Cawnpore in 1798 Colonel J. F. Meiselbach, a military 
adventurer in the service of Himmat Bahadur in Bundelkhand, and after- 
wards commanding the local najib battalion, the adjutant of which was 
W. R. Jones, a brother of Mrs. Dyce. Mrs. Dyce was at the end of her 
life described as "of Agra", and the family must have gone there before 



195 

1857. She died at Agra in 1870, and together with her husband, who 
pre-deceased her by one year, was buried in St. Paul's Church cemetery. 
A confusing record of this family is the registration of the marriage of a 
Thomas Leopold Dyce to Emma Coles in 1842. There is either a 
mistake in the Christian name, or he is the son of Thomas Leopold Dyce, 
senior. The latter interpretation is not unlikely ; for there was a parallel 
case at Fatehgarh in the Anthony family. 

To the south of Dyce's compound lived Eliza, the daughter of Colonel 
Hickman (commanding the Provincial Battalion 1824-28. Buried in the 
Fort cemetery) and Mt. Jamiat of Fatehgarh. She was alive in 1849. 
Other residents in this block were Wright and Nicholas, Eurasian clerks ; 
Mt, Khairan, or Bibi Palmer, who owned two bungalows on the Maude 
Lines' site; Mrs. Polly Meickle, Portuguese ; Home and Macklin, clerks in 
the Collectorate Office. They appear one and all to have fallen on hard 
times, and eventually by sale, or mortgage, their properties passed to 
Kanhaya Lai, the local money lender. 

In the road to the east of the Civil Hospital compound were two 
bungalows and a kothi on the eastern side of the road. The first bunga- 
low at the corner was the soda water store and shop of Kanhaya Lai, whose 
descendants are still there. He advanced money to the poorer residents on 
mortgages all over the station. The kothi was inhabited by Mirza Kalbe 
Hu sa in, Deputy Collector, whose service ended in 1856*. He was given an 
extension of one year, and disappeared in the Mutiny, after sticking to his 
court to the last moment with the help of Captain Vibart. In this direction 
to the south was a house belonging to Nawab Hakim Mehdi Ali Khan, 
which he gave to the Rani of Tirwa. This house was called Brown Sahib's 
compound. Nothing is known of Brown. A Mr. Brown of the Civil 
Service was granted leave on medical certificate in 1817. His name does 
not appear in the East India Calendar as an official at Fatehgarh in 
that or any other year, but the revenue records mention him. 

North of the District Courts is a thatched bungalow, in which the Civil 
Surgeon lived after the Mutiny up to a recent date. Nothing of its history 
in pre-Mutiny times has come to light. Mrs. Sturt (see " Fatehgarh and the 
Mutiny ") appeal's to have been living in it when the Mutiny broke out in 



106 

the Station. Next door is the Superintendent of Police's bungalow at the 
present date. This house, similarly, has no pre-Mutiny records, although 
it was in existence. Part of its compound, abutting on the main road, and 
part of the compound to the north were joined together to form the residence 
of the Bush family after 1807. From 1859 to 1895 the District Judge 
had this bungalow as his residence. In this house M. B. Thornhili wrote 
his " Haunts and Hobbies of an Indian Official " in 1865, a copy of which 
is in the Club library. The terraced garden, of which he speaks, can be 
traced on the river bank. The first Police Superintendent was Lieut. A .B. 
Thomas (Dec. I860), and since he was mostly on tour in the district 
gathering evidence against mutineers, it cannot be said if he had a house 
at Fatehgarh, or not. 

The earliest record of the Judge's house is 1835. It then belonged to 
an indigo planter named Smith, and was known as Smith Sahib's bungalow 
ever afterwards. It passed into the hands of Nawab Hakim Mehdi AM 
Khan; and it seems that Mr. Buller, the Judge, who came in 18552, found 
himself dispossessed of the old Judge's residence, and had to move in here ; 
but on the departure of Maharaja Dhuleep Singh in 1854 he moved to the 
Maharaja's house opposite No, 2 X Bungalow. In 1854 Mr. Lushington, 
officiating Collector, was the occupier. The house was completely wrecked 
by the mutineers. It was the residence of Mr. Probyn, the Collector, when 
the Mutiny broke out. In 1859 Mr. Lindsay, the Collector, also decided to 
live in this compound ; and on inspection the Valuation Committee found a 
well, a few trees, and a heap of bricks. Not an atom of wood had been left. 
They valued the property at Rs. 200. Sukhbasi Lai Sadh, and two others, 
then bought it at this price, and constructed the present house. The last 
Collector to live here was Mr. Cornwall from 1882. In his time the river 
wall had to be constructed to keep the house from falling into the river. Mr. 
Growse, preferring the present Collector's residence, allowed the Railway 
Engineer to occupy it. The Judge afterwards moved in, when the Railway 
Engineer went to his present house. 

The stately house, which comes next on the river bank, belonged to 
Mrs. Hannah Collins. The original structure was damaged by the 
mutineers; but enough remained in 1861 to fetch the good price of 



107 

Rs, 2,710, when Mr. J. A. Collins of Delhi sold the property with three 
masonry wells to Mr. Briant, merchant. The latter with his family had 
left by river for Allahabad, a week before the outbreak of the Mutiny. 
The District Opium Officer occupied it up to 1933. 

The three adjoining compounds to the north have changed appearance. 
In 1835 they contained five small bungalows, the northernmost one having 
three families living separately in it. The bungalows all belonged to 
Babu Kanhaya Lai. Even before the Mutiny they had disappeared 
without leaving a trace in the records. In their place one large compound 
came into being, the house of which was burnt accidentally. Close by, 
Bargadia Ghat and the old bridge of 1788 mark the boundary of the 
Civil Lines. 



CHAPTER XL 

THE DISTRICT COURTS AND ADMINISTRATION. 



JTTJHE large compound opposite the High School, in which the tomb of 
J[ Head Surgeon Hamilton is conspicuous, has been the home of 
judicial courts since 1807. Before that date nothing certain of its 
history is known. The eighteenth century records point to the first 
General-Hospital's location in this direction, and it is also stated that the 
Head Surgeon lived by his hospital. The General Hospital may therefore 
have been to the north of Hamilton's tomb in this compound, or in the 
Company Garden, since according to another record it was on the edge of 
the Sudder Bazar. As far as local tradition can be trusted, the bank of 
the Ganges in the Civil Lines was bordered by the houses of wealthy 
indigo and cotton merchants. One of them, Charles Bathurst, sold his 
residence to Government in 1807 for Rs. 12,000. This house was pur- 
chased for the Judge Magistrate's court, and it is even now the District 
Judge's court, having thus an unbroken history of 126 years. Charles 
and James Bathurst were the sons of Robert Bathurst, Superintendent of 
the Salt Department in 180J3, and senior partner of Bathurst, Bush &amp; Co., 
which started trading at Fatehgarh in 1791. Robert Bathurst dropped 
out of the firm in 1830, his two sons carrying on a general trading busi- 
ness for another ten years. On leaving this house the family went to a 
smaller bungalow in a corner of the present Superintendent of Police's 
compound. 

Little information about the Residents, who represented the East 
India Company at the Nawab's Durbar in the City, is to be found in the 
records up to 1802. There were only two of them, and it is known that 
they lived in special quarters, assigned for their residence. In 1780 there 
was Mr. Shea, and then came an interregnum of four years, after which 
Mr. Willes, the son of Mr. Justice Willes at Calcutta, was appointed by 
Warren Hastings. The Resident's post was not an easy one, and Willes 
and the Nawab were constantly bickering. In 1785 Warren Hastings had 



190 

to censure them both, and eventually Willes was removed. The appoint- 
ment of a Resident, after engaging to withdraw him, was the fifth charge 
of the impeachment of Warren Hastings. Up to the cession of the District, 
supervision of the Nawab was undertaken by the Resident at Luck now, 
and the arrangement worked successfully, since by careful organisation 
correspondence was made to reach Lucknow in about forty-eight hours. 
Well known Residents like Colonel Gabriel Harper and G. F. Cherry 
(murdered at Benares in 1799) were sufficiently prominent in Farrukha- 
bad affairs as to find mention in private letters at the time. 

The date of cession to the East India Company by the Nawab of 
Farrukhabad was* the 4th June 18052 ; and in the Collector's record room 
there has recently been found a bound copy of the original treaty between 
the Company and Nawab Nasir-i-Jang. This must have been the private 
copy of the second Agent to the Governor-General, for it has the signature 
of Mr. ('laud Russell on the fly leaf. In 1802, therefore, the fiscal history 
of the District commences along with that of other districts transferred to 
the Company by the Nawab Vizier of Oudh. A great many experiments 
were made, and the successive changes of administration arc hard to under- 
stand. Only a sketch can be given here. For greater detail reference to 
Dewars " Handbook to the English Pre-Mutiny Records of the United 
Provinces " is essential. A Board of Commissioners for the Ceded Pro- 
vinces had been set up in 1801 under the Honourable Henry Wellesley, a 
brother of the Governor-General, the Marquis of Wellesley and also of 
the future Duke of Wellington. To be absolutely clear, it has to be 
remembered that there were two cessions of the District. One cession was 
by Nawab Saadat Ali, the Vizier of Oudh, for payment of debts owed to 
the East India Company. He was overlord of the Nawab of Farrukhabad, 
who by hereditary right held vast estates in this and adjoining districts. 
The local Nawab hastened to Bareilly in 1802 to make cession of his 
rights of sovereignty over these estates in return for a settled allowance 
to be paid from the treasury at Fatehgarh, but he retained of course a 
large family domain, which he managed as private property. 

Henry Wellesley, afterwards a diplomat and better known by the 
title of Lord Cowley, administered the large territory, covering Rohil- 



200 

khand, the Duab, and the Gorakhpur Division, from Bareilly. Fatehgarh, 
nevertheless, was said to be the headquarters of the new Board, and 
Graeme Mercer certainly worked at Fatehgarh, either as a member of the 
Board, or as its local agent. The Board, however, was dissolved on the 
21st February 1805. The Ceded Provinces were formed into seven 
districts of enormous extent, and Farrukhabad was one of them with 
boundaries enclosing four or five modern districts. Each district, except 
Farrukhabad, had a Judge Magistrate and a Collector to administer them. 
Farrukhabad had an official called the Agent to the Governor-General, 
who managed the revenues until the appointment of the first Collector in 
180(&gt;. In March 1803 the first Judge Magistrate, Mr. Grant, appeared, 
coming from Benares to take over judicial and executive charge by virtue 
of Regulation II of that year. Mr. Grant was busy in restoring law and 
order to a district which sadly needed it. Mr. Graeme Mercer, who was 
a surgeon by profession, carried out the first settlement of revenue, which 
was to last for three years. The revenue amounted to nearly eleven lakhs 
for an area equal to the present District. The right to collect rent and 
pay revenue was put up to auction, a reserve price having been fixed on 
the basis of the average of the four preceding years. A second settle- 
ment for the years 1805 to 1808 produced just over eleven lakhs ; and 
the third settlement for four years from 1808 to 1812 increased the 
revenue demand to over 11J lakhs yearly. The first Collector, Mr. 
Cockburn, relieved the Agent of all revenue duties, the Agent himself 
being abolished. Political work in connection with the Nawab of 
Farrukhabad was thenceforth carried on by the District Judge, until in 
]84r3 the appointment of Agent to the Governor-General was deemed 
obsolete. 

The collection of the revenue was difficult during these early years 
owing to the prevailing spirit of lawlessness, encouraged by Mahratta 
raids and the violence of a Mohamedan tribe called Mewatti. The 
Mewattis were greatly feared. Zemindars erected mud forts as a protec- 
tion against them. Prosperous villages surrounded themselves with walls, 
moats, and impenetrable jungles of bamboo to hinder all access to the 
invader. On the 17th March 1809 Kam bar, a Mewatti, entered the 



201 

District with a hundred followers, and looted Nawabganj. Two companies 
of infantry and two guns had to be sent from Fatehgarh to disperse his 
band. In the Nawabgauj pargana lived Pirthi Singh, a celebrated free- 
booter, who in Nawabi times had suffered punishment at the hands of 
Almas AM Khan by having had his hands and feet cut off and both eyes 
blinded. Despite this handicap he persisted in highway robbery and 
murder, until by a Government order dated 15th December 1809 his 
whole property was confiscated. In this same year the Collector, Mr. 
Donnithorne, crossed the Ganges with a company of infantry in order to 
collect the revenue, and had to blow up a mud fort, which barred his wny. 
In 1815 this Collector had again to requisition a company of infantry for 
the same work. The Judge, being Magistrate and Superintendent of 
Police, was overworked and harassed by the Collector, who was always 
demanding assistance. He had little time for office work, and was always 
out in the District with his mounted policemen, chasing dacoits, Mewattis, 
and Mahrattas. The violence of the times was reflected in the crudeness 
of the criminal law, which as then administered was according to 
Mohamedan tenets. Trial by ordeal, that is, by holding a red hot cannon- 
ball in the hands, was in force when the Company took over the District. 
The taking of oath by this ordeal was set aside for the oath on Ganges 
water, or on the Koran, and iu 1840 the present form of affirmation was 
substituted. 

From 1804 onwards the existence of secret societies in the District 
was discovered. In the southern parganas and the northern parts of the 
modern district of Etawah sixty-seven bodies were found in wells, an 
examination of which pointed to murder by strangling. Investigation dis- 
closed that the members of the Mewatti tribe, and the Lodhas around 
Kanauj Town were practising this form of murder on a most extensive 
scale. A report by Mr. Wright, the Assistant Magistrate, on the activi- 
ties of these stranglers, or Thugs as they were called, was so illuminating 
that Government circulated it in 1810 to all districts for information. In 
1811 a list of sixty-eight Thugs, who worked the roads of Farrukhabad 
and Etawah was compiled from informers, and four years later the 
Fatehgarh Jail had numbers of them in confinement. For some reason 



202 

Government was slow to recognise this new menace to society, and it was 
not until the thirties that General Sleeman and officials of the Thuggi 
Department were able to control this species of crime. Farrukhabad 
District had an unenviable reputation for it, and in 1833 Farrukhabad 
Thugs were being caught iu the Punjab. The Thugs formed gangs of 
robbers, who were disciplined by officers and worked under the glamour 
of religious rites. Their raids were carried out on the advice of priests, 
who consulted the omens regularly. A book, published in 1837, entitled 
" Illustrations of the History and Practices of the Thugs " shows that the 
Thugs moved along the roads looking for wealthy travellers, whose 
confidence they gained by friendly conversation. At an auspicious 
moment, usually at sunset, or daybreak, they strangled and robbed their 
victim, considering the murder as a sacrifice to Devi, who was revered by 
Hindoos and Mohamedans alike. The body was generally thrown into a 
deep well, and the Thugs' well at Kanauj is still pointed out by tradition. 
The crime of strangling much declined with the advent of railways, but 
the terror inspired by the operations of the stranglers lasted long. The 
modern Code of Criminal Procedure, still mentions iu Section 181 "the 
offence of being a Thug." 

Regulation X of 180T established a Board of two members to super- 
vise the Collectors in. the -Ceded Provinces. This Board was called the 
Board of Commissioners for the Ceded Provinces. It lasted down to 1822, 
and its office was at Fatehgarh. The locality in which this office was 
situated has not been discovered, but since the Board was followed by the 
appointment of a Commissioner, whose office was in the building now 
known as the Collector's cutcherry, it might reasonably be presumed that 
the Board also worked. in the Collectorate compound. In 1822, however, 
the Board sold its old office to Gopal Das, banker, for Hs. 15,000. No 
record of any sale by Gopal Das exists, and the property in question is 
unknown to his descendants. This is a matter for regret, because this 
Board was the ancestor of the present Board of Revenue, and its corres- 
pondence exists in abundance, written as it was ffom Fatehgarh and other 
places; for the Board often went on tour with a prodigious following of 
fifteen hundred persons ! Members of this Board, who resided at Fatehgarh, 



203 

. when not on tour, were W. R. Cox ; H. St. G. Tucker ; Sir Edward 
Colebrooke, Bart; J. Deane; A. Ross; W. H. Trant; E. S. Waring; 
and H. Newnhara. The last named member was Secretary to the Board 
for many years and .a very old resident of Fatehgarh. 

The proximity of the Board was a great nuisance to the Collector, 
whose proceedings naturally came under the eyes of the Members more 
frequently than was the case of other Collectors. On the 26th August 
1817, for example, a petition was presented at the Board's office com- 
plaining of abuses by the Sudder officers. The Junior Member, Mr. Trant, 
was at once deputed to go to the Collector's Court in Kasim Bagh and 
watch him, while he made enquiry into this complaint against his officers 
and himself. The Collector resented this close supervision, and corres- 
pondence between the Board and various Collectors' of the District is 
interesting from this point of view. Mr. H. Swetenham (Collector 1880- 
24) appears to have been of a fiery nature. On the 5th April 18J20 he 
was censured by the Board for not having distributed rewards to his 
tahsildars in a fitting manner. Mr. Swetenham replied as follows: " It 
is with sensation of real pain I have this day perused the Board's letter of 
the 90th ult. The Board in the exercise of their control can adopt the 
language of severity at discretion. I submit to their commands with full 
respect to their authority, but by the construction of the 2nd para, above 
I am intercepted in the career of business. 1 cannot venture to pass orders 
whilst labouring under the stigma implied in the para, above alluded to, 
reprehended and rebuked, nay even branded and villified by a superior 
power." The Board ordered him to withdraw these remarks, or complaint 
would be made to Government at Calcutta. Further on in the year the 
Collector became resigned to the Board's unceasing vigilance, for in another 
letter, after pointing out what he would have done in the circumstances, 
he hastens to add : " Time has effaced the more delicate and more easily 
irritated feelings of Youth,, and experience has taught me to become 
callous!" 

The Collector at this period administered nearly all the modern 
district of Etah, and a good portion of Eta wah, in addition to Farrukhabad. 
Eventually the Etah territory became the sub-collectorate of Sirhpura, 



204 

which lasted up to 1845. The Etawah sub-coliectorate was called Bela, 
and it was separated from Farrukhabad in 1838. The Collector at 
Fatehgarh controlled both these sub-collectorates. In addition to his 
ordinary revenue duties he was also Mint Master, receiving an extra 
allowance of Rs. 350 for this post. 

In 1883 the Board of Commissioners disappeared, giving way to a 
Board of Revenue for the Western Province. This Board had its head- 
quarters at Delhi. In 1825 it was ordered to go to Bareilly and until the 
necessary buildings were erected, it was to work at Fatehgarh, The records 
were placed in Colonel Brown's house at Rakha, and business was conduc- 
ted in a bungalow taken on lease. In 1829 this Board went in its turn. 
A Sudder Board of Revenue at Calcutta appeared, and new administrative 
officers, called Commissioners of Circuit and Reveune, acting under the 
Sudder Board, took charge of the Ceded Provinces. These Commissioners 
did the work of a modern Sessions Judge, and also supervised the adminis- 
tration of Judge Magistrates and Collectors. The 3rd, or Farrukhabad 
Division, comprised the districts of Farrukhabad, Mainpuri, Etawah, and 
the sub-collectorate of Sirhpura. The Commissioner's office, called the 
Circuit House, was that building now occupied by the officers and courts 
of the Collectorate. From 1829 to 1838, therefore, the appearance of 
the Collectorate compound was gradually assuming its modern shape. The 
Judge Magistrate occupied the present Sessions Court, and there was a 
Court for the Subordinate Judge behind. Besides the Circuit House in 
the middle, there existed the tomb of Head Surgeon Hamilton, the well, 
and a havalat, or lock-up for under trial prisoners, on the site of the old 
police barracks, and behind the present Police Club. This lock-up was 
built in 1814 by Mr. Elliott for Rs. 2,500. It was in the Commissioners' 
times described as a " bomb proof building ", and was guarded by a 
duffadar and eight sepoys. A havalat for civil prisoners was made on the 
site of the Judge's garden behind his court. All these buildings were 
smaller than they are to-day. The Circuit House, which was the largest 
of them, had only half of its present extent. 

The first Commissioner was Henry Newnham, who for long had held 
the post of Secretary to the Ceded Provinces' Board. His connection 



205 

with Fatehgarh started in 1812. He entered the Company's service 
in 1802, serving in many appointments long since obsolete, such as that 
of Collector of Customs, Superintendent of Resources in 1815, Mint 
Master 1824, and member of the Board of Revenue for the Western 
Province up to 1829. He had also been Collector of the District. He 
lived in the Mall Road, his compound covering those of No. 17 and 
No. 18 Bungalows. This residence was known by his name do A n to the 
Mutiny. The records contain a good deal of his correspondence, which 
shows him to have been an official of great experience in the Revenue 
Department. There is a curious report by him to the Board concerning 
an affray in the south of the District, in which his orderlies were 
concerned. It appears that they were escorting his family to the bazar 
of a small town in order to purchase stores, when dacoits attacked them. 
The family turned out to be an Indian lady living under Newnham's 
protection. It was this lady who erected the Kerbela behind the present 
Police Lines. Newnham built the Lai Serai in the City, restored the 
Bangash tomb at Mau Rashidabad, and was much respected by the 
inhabitants of the District. 

In 1832, the Commissioner had a large staff of four assistants 
namely Messrs. Gilmore, Morgan, Totenham, and Travel's. These gentle- 
men helped to make up a civilian staff of nine officers, which was a total 
never reached again ; for as a civil station Fatehgarh was at its zenith 
in the thirties, and then aferwards declined, as the Cantonment had 
done. A Viscount Exmouth was assistant in 1834. Mr. Boulderson 
was the last Commissioner and a friend of Nawab Hakim Mehdi Ali 
Khan. The latter was fond of displaying his knowledge of English; 
and on hearing that the Commissionership had been abolished, he wrote 
a letter of condolence to Mr. Boulderson, in which he concluded with 
the following curse: " And as for the man who formed the idea of 
doing away with your appointment, my dear friend, may God blast him 
under the earth." 

Other Commissioners wereR.H. Tulloh ; E.J. Hnrington; W. Monckton 
{India 1814-42. Judge of the High Court. Died 1875); H. Swetenham ; 
H. Fraser (India 1814-41. Judge of Delhi. Died 1843); and H. S. 



206 

Boulderson (India 1817*52. Member, Board of Revenue. Died 1877). 
In 1858 the 3rd Division was amalgamated 'with that of Agra, Mr. 
Boulderson being the first Commissioner of the new Division at Agra. 
When he vacated the Circuit House, the Collector at once moved in "from 
the Mint House. 

The Collectorate compound then assumed its present appearance. 
The Circuit House was lengthened to the south. The Record Room 
block to the north-east was built, and the land by Hamilton's tomb, which 
was covered with lines for the Police after the Mutiny, was occupied by 
the stables and lines of the mounted orderlies. On the river bank was a 
a chir khana ", or morgue, for post mortems on corpses. The arcaded 
building, south of Hamilton's tomb, is said by ba/ar tradition to have 
Ixien a serai. This is not the case, for the building was cons tructed for 
the Treasury. All the buildings were damaged in the Mutiny by the 
41st N. 1., and the majority of the records were burnt. Records, picked 
up from the ground ou the re-occupation of the Station, were bound 
together, and are to be viewed .in the Record Room. The volumes of the 
1833 Settlement were also salvaged, and show no trace of damage. 
They must have been concealed in a safe place by Mr. Probyn, the 
Collector, when the Mutiny broke out. A few old sale deeds were 
recovered, which are now to be seen in the Registrar's office. The bulk 
of the records, so far as they relate to correspondence with the Commis- 
sioner, was fortunately at Agra, and has come down intact to the present 
day. These records give all requisite information for a study of the pre- 
Mutiny administration in detail. Dewar's handbook to the records of the 
Province indicates their scope and contents. 

It has been seen that the third settlement of the revenue ended in 
XHV2. Mr. Donnithome, the Collector, prepared the fifth, which was to 
last up to 1817, providing for a revenue of roughly thirteen and a 
quarter lakhs. This settlement was prolonged by five yearly extensions 
up to 1836. Mr. Donnithorne's assessment was extremely unpopular. 
The only detailed survey, which he carried out, was necessitated by the 
uncompromising attitude of Raja Jaswant Singh of Tirwa. In November 
1813 Mr. Donnithorne proceeded himself to inspect the Raja's villages in 



207 

Chhibramau and Bewar. As he approached each village the Raja's 
agents abducted the village accountant, and concealed the estate papers. 
The result was a detailed survey of the estate, a measure forced on 
Mr. Donnithorne, which as a matter of fact proved a valuable guide for 
assessment purposes, and showed that the original estimates, rough 
though they were, had not been unfair. These haphazard methods of 
assessment were dropped iu 1836-37, when the fifth settlement was under- 
taken under Regulation IX of 1835. Those settlement operations were 
distinguished by a scientific survey of the District, completed between 
1833 and 1839. One of the officers who worked at it was Lieutenant 
Henry Lawrence, afterwards Sir Henry Lawrence, K. C. B. (1806-57), 
the defender of the Residency at Lucknow, He was then a member of 
the Revenue Survey of the N. W. Provinces. The assessment had to lie 
reduced twice in confequence of the famine of 1837 and a plague of 
locusts in 1843. In 1845 the revenue assessed was eleven and a half 
lakhe ; and with the exception of a slight increase after the Mutiny, it 
was kept at about these figures for twenty years. The 1833 Settlement, 
as this assessment was called, was never popular It was affected by 
extraordinary calamities, which laid waste all that part of the District to 
the south of the Kali Nadi. The huge profits made by indigo planters, 
who had formed themselves into companies managing large estates, had 
been taken into account. Unfortunately just after 1833 the planters 
began to suffer losses, probably as the result of over production. The 
records tell of the ruin of many factories, and the withdrawal of wealthy 
planters and brokers like Mercer, Brand, Martin, Storr, Bruce, and others. 
Much land became waste, and landed property was so cheap that pur- 
chasers could not be found for it. By 1840 the golden age of indigo 
planting was over in Fatehgarh. 

The Judge was District Magistrate up to 1833, and also head of the 
Police. He was assisted by an official called the " Register." This 
name has often been confused with that of '* Registrar/' who was nearly 
always a subordinate, and carried out entirely different duties. The 
Register was the prototype of the modern joint magistrate, and he seems 
to have administered the Police for the Judge. On occasions he officiated 



208 

for the Judge Magistrate. His office at Fatehgarh was closed on the 
14th January 1833. The Collector, ou the other hand, was only 
concerned with the assessment and collection of revenue, hence the title 
of " Collector." The collection of revenue in those days was a work of 
some difficulty, as was only to be expected in the case of an official, who had 
no strong executive powers, and no force with which to exact compliance 
from the landholders, secure in their mud forts. A good example is to be 
found in the records of 1830 in connection with the Collector's attempt 
to eject certain defaulters from Dobeh Fort (now in Etawah District). 
The Collector (Mr. Nisbet) called upon the then acting Judge (Mr. 
Taylor) for help. Mr. Taylor sent the nearest police from Talgram 
Police station ; but they had to retreat. Military aid was demanded; 
and two companies of the 17th N. F. under Captain Wilson were sent by 
the Officer Commanding, Major Hawthorne, in June. The Government 
at Calcutta was much incensed. Mr. Taylor was ordered to submit his 
explanation, which he did with much verbosity. He concluded his excuses 
by saying: " I am fully and deeply impressed with the feeling, that 
Government is averse to the resort of such measures, unless when positively 
and urgently called for, and that at all times they demand the observance 
of the most mature deliberation/ * Government was unable to think 
of anything to answer. The record gives a description of this fort at 
Dobeh, which enables one to picture village strongholds of that day. It 
was 75 feet square. The walls were faced with mud, and were 15 feet 
high and 9 feet thick, loopholed at the top for matchlocks. A dry ditch, 
3 feet deep and 18 feet broad, surrounded the whole, an ample protection 
in the rains. 

The first District and Sessions Judge was the Honourable F. J. Shore, 
who for the first two years of his stay at Fatehgarh was Judge Magistrate 
under the old arrangements. His notes give an illuminating description 
of what went on at Fatehgarh, when the Judge, occupied with executive 
work, had little time for the conduct of cases. His arrears of work from 
1831 were 243 original suits; 3,640 executions of decrees, and 750 
miscellaneous cases. In October 1829 two cases of murder had been 
tried by the Commissioner of Farrukbabad, and referred to the Chief 



209 

Criminal Court for orders of hanging. Up to the end of 1832 no orders 
had been received. Shore also drew attention to the procedure of the 
Supreme Court of Justice at Calcutta, which by sending bailiffs all over 
India, could arrest any one merely on information of a debt being sworn 
at Calcutta, and drag them down to that city under arrest. This 
iniquitous system was responsible for two cises at Fatehgarh. Nawab 
Hakim Mehdi Ali Khan was treated in this way. He vainly offered to 
pay the sum demande 1 rather than waste months in going to Calcutta. 
He was only saved by the interference of the whole population of 
Cantonments. In 1830 the temple at Singhirampore was suddenly attached 
on a writ from the Supreme Court. All claimants were told to go to 
Calcutta and prove their cases there. 

The Judge before 1853(3 was magistrate, police superintendent, and 
public prosecutor rolled in one, and he was far busier over the suppression 
of crime than the deciding of civil suits. His court was a pandemonium. 
The court clerk took evidence in a corner, questioning the witnesses in 
Urdu, and writing the result in bad Persian. The Judge often tried two 
or three cases simultaneously in this manner. The clerks read out the 
evidence at great speed ; the Mohamedan law officer gave a legal opinion 
from the standpoint of Mohamedan criminal law ; and the Judge rapidly 
wrote out his judgment, often on a scrap of paper. This in fact was easy 
work for him, for he had himself already investigated the case at his 
bungalow before it came up for trial! After 183;3 his establishment 
comprised a subordinate judge and six munsifs. Ten vakils practised in 
the courts at Sudder, and forty-nine in the Munsifs' courts. 

The Collector took over the Magistrate's office from the Judge. It 
was not amalgamated, with the revenue department but the staff of each 
was kept separate. To take the revenue office first, two departments 
existed side by side, called the English and Persian offices, although 
practically speaking the office attached to the District Magistrate's court 
was also part of the Persian one. The writing of documents in a Persian 
jargon was stopped in 18136, and the name of this office disappeared. 
Persian, however, continued to be written in barbarous fashion in the 
civil courts for three years longer. The English office had a head clerk 



•2ky 

on Rs. 150, who was usually a Eurasian, and three clerks on Rs. 80, 
Rs. 50 and Rs. 30. This number was increased by two more English 
writers after 1840. The Persian office had twelve clerks on various 
duties, such as the sarrishtedar and his assistant; the tauzib navis and 
the jama kharch navis (accountants) ; the diary writer; the uazir and 
his assistant; and others besides twenty-five peons on Rs. 4 each There 
were eight menials, including some with curious duties like the farrash, 
or carpet spreader, and the gangajallu, or purveyor of Ganges water to 
Hindu litigants. The Treasury had a treasurer on Rs. 50 and seven 
clerks. The Magistrate's court had attached to it a sarrishtedar, 1 
uazir, 14 clerks, 18 peons, 1 jemadar, and 48 mounted orderlies. Even 
taking into consideration the low rate of pay of the members of this 
establishment at headquarters, the numbers as compared with those of 
the present day appear to be excessive. 

The superior district staff, besides the Collector, was ordinarily a 
deputy collector and joint magistrate on Rs. 1,000, two assistant magistrates 
on Rs. 400 each, and a doctor on Rs. 350. The Tahsils, or revenue offices 
in the District, were always changing, but were usually eight, or nine, in 
number. The one at headquarters was called the " Huzur Tahsil." It 
had no tahsildar, but was presided over by a peshkar, or naib tahsildar, 
assisted by 10 clerks, 2 jemadars and 70 peons. The term "peshkar" is 
still used by country people to designate a naib talisildar. Tahsildars 
existed at Talgram (in the Fort), Azaninagar (now a pargana of Etah 
District), Shamsabad, Amritpur, Kanauj, Khakatmau, Thatia-Tirwa, and 
Sakatpur. After 18525 the headquarters of the Shamsabad Tahsil was 
shifted to Kaimganj in consequence of a burglary of the Treasury. 
Sakatpur varied with Saurikh as headquarters of a revenue sub-division. 
The office at Kanauj was iu the Fort up to 1840. It was then sold for 
Rs. 600, and in 1846 there was not a trace of it left. Only Kanauj out 
of all these tahsils remains to-day as a revenue sub-division. The modern 
sub-division of Chhibramau was abolished in 1818, and was not revived 
until 1840, since which date it has continued to the present time. The 
sub-collectorate of Sirhpura, which covered three -quarters of the area of 
the modern district of Etah, had its separate staff. It passed out of the 



211 

control of the Collector in 1845. Similarly, the sub-eollectorate of Bela 
(a large portion of Etawah District) had its own officials, and was free of 
Farrukhabad in 1838. An important department of the Col lee tor a te was 
that of the mail runners, who to the number of seventy-two (each on Rs. 3 
monthly) had to convey the Collector's orders to all tahsils and police 
thanas. The immense extent of the district, from Etah to Etawah, 
rendered necessary the employment of a large number of men. The 
mounted orderlies were also used for this work ; and the carriage of office 
records and correspondence was most expeditious. 

Police arrangements in Cantonments were few. There was a Kotwali 
in Fatehgarh Saddar bazar, containing a jemadar on Rs. 25 and a 
mounted man on Rs. 18. Two other sowars on Rs. 18 each patrolled the 
Cantonment roads, and were called " rounds," or Kofe-gashtee, (patrolling 
of lanes). There was, nevertheless, a considerable establishment in the 
district under the orders of the Magistrate and Commissioner. The Joint 
Magistrate practically carried out the duties of a modern Superintendent 
of Police for the Magistrate. There were police stations at Talgram, 
Amritpur, Khakatmau, Kamalganj, Mohamdabad, Chhibramau and 
Shaimabad ; while a large number of outposts at other places were almost 
as big as the police stations. Talgram in 1835 had a thanadaron Rs. 30, 
n jemadar on Rs. 8, mohiirrir on Rs. 8, duffadaron Rs. 5, 39 hurkandazes 
on Rs. 4 each. Other expenses allowed were repairs and stationery, 
Rs. 5. The total monthly cost of one police station was thus Rs. £12. 
Some Collectorate workers were not paid. In 1835 sixteen convicts from 
the jail pulled the punkhas in office. It is said that Mr. Robinson (the 
Collector), Mr. Rose (the Joint Magistrate), Mr. Kinloch (the Collector 
of Customs), and the office clerks divided the 16 amongst themselves. The 
Commissioner had eleven convicts pulling in his office ; the Judge six, and 
only 25 convicts were living in the jail, after deducting the punkha 
pullers and gangs working on the roads. 

The correspondence between the Commissioner and the Collector 
reveal many proceedings, which have long since become obsolete. By 
Government order of the 14th October 1820 dwtrict officials had to take 
three oaths, when entering on their appointments. These were the oaths 



212 

of office, supremacy, and allegiance. On the accession of Queen Victoria 
to the throne in 1887, apparently every one in the Province had to renew 
these oaths, and an official came from Bengal to administer them. The 
subjects on which officials discoursed before the Mutiny had a very wide 
range, and were always described in a stilted and pedantic style. They 
seem often to be of incongruous character, as when the Commissioner 
recommends a mixture for combating the white ant menace ; the Joint 
Magistrate writes an essay on the confinement of prisoners in stocks ; the 
Collector casually mentions postage stamps in 1854 for the first time; the 
Judge Iannounces the victories of Mud ki and Ferozeshahr over the Sikhs. 
Mention can be found of every possible topic, extending from important 
problems of revenue to demands for the most petty requirements, in the 
purchase of which the Collector was allowed no discretion at all. In 1812 
Mr. Donnithorne complained that his office tent was more than four years 
old. He asked leave to buy a new one for the modest sum of Rs. 150. 
Government not only refused, but added insult to injury by ordering him 
to have the tent condemned first by the Officer Commanding, and submit 
a certificate to that effect. In 18]7. the Collector had actually to write 
to the Governor-General at Calcutta for sanction to employ a daftri, or 
book binder, on Rs. (i monthly. In 1841 the Commissioner refused to 
allow the Collector- to buy a table cloth for Rs. 7. The District 
Magistrate officially demanded Rs. 2 for repairing a ladder; Rs. 5 for a 
little floor matting; Rs. 4 for an office box ; Re. 1 for a pair of 
handcuffs ; Re. 1/12, for repairing the office door ; the appointment of a 
sweeper on Rs. 3 monthly. This last request was not sanctioned on the 
ground that it was extravagant. In 1832 after some correspondence 
Rs. 9/12, was obtained from Government for watering the drooping trees 
in Cantonments during May and June. The money was granted so 
reluctantly that the District Magistrate did not apparently ever apply for 
it again. He was sufficiently busy in having to submit a vast number of 
returns. Some of them appear to be really comic like that which called 
for a statement of the number of Presbyterians in Fatehgarh, who belonged 
neither to the Free Church, nor to the Established Church of Scotland. 
The Collector's answer has been lost, and rightly so ! 



CHAPTER XII. 

RAKHA AND THE CAVALRY LINES. 



THE road from Cantonments to Rakha was made at the first occupa- 

1 tion of Fatehgarh, and was one of the chief avenues of approach 

to the City, which it entered by the Madar Gate. The other main road 
to the City was the Qadri Gate Road through the present Railway Lines. 
Both roads were metalled in the forties, but the Madar Gate Road from 
the site of the Central Jail up to the City was only completed in 1850. 
In proceeding towards Rakha the Golf Links are first seen on the left. 
The bridge over the nullah was built by Nawab Hakim Mehdi AM Khan 
in 1830. The modem Golf Links and the land opposite it on the other 
side of the road, were part of the Cavalry Cantonment. 

Before reaching the High School Boarding House and the new Police 
Lines, a bare tract will be seen to the east of the road, which was the 
location of the old ice pits. The Reserve Inspector's house covers a portion 
of the area. Before the discovery of modem methods, ice had to be made 
in winter by inducing pans of water to freeze in trenches prepared for the 
purpose. The old manner is minutely described by Mrs Fanny Parks ; 
and here it is sufficient to say that an abdar dwelt on the ice field, whose 
business it was to summon coolies to collect the ice from the pan*, and 
pack it into straw lined pits to await the next hot weather. These opera- 
tions continued up to a fairly recent date; for there is still a water carrier 
living in Fatehgarh Town, who worked in these ice fields as a boy. The 
managers of the Ice House Committee at Fatehgarh were the General, or 
Colonel Commanding, the Major, and Judge Magistrate. In October the 
Committee met and settled the rates, then informing all residents of the 
Station and leading raises in the Town. All who wished to subscribe paid 
a deposit in October. The cost at Fatehgarh was usually Rs. 10 per seer 
for the entire season. A subscriber, who joined after February, had to 
pay Rs. 2 more per seer, and later on the price rose every fortnight for 
new subscribers. The supply lasted from 6 to 8 months Any subscriber 



214 

leaving the Station sold his share to another after giving notice, other- 
wise his deposit was forfeited. Ice was supplied daily at 4 a. m.; and 
the rules were strict in requiring punctual attendance of all subscribers' 
servants. Once the pits were closed, they could not be reopened, and late 
arrivals received no issue. 

The ice pits are just within the area of Kutra village, and the 
bungalows of the cavalry officers were actually within the boundaries of 
the same area. The cavalry stables and parade ground were in Rakha 
village, ami both village areas together made up the Cavalry Cantonment. 
The name Rakha was generally applied to both of them. To the east of 
the ice pits is to-day the extensive compound belonging to the Raja of 
Tirwa. It was the property of G. G. Moiv up to 1846, and further east 
on the very bank of the Ganges was a small bungalow, which was used by 
the Haja of Tirwa at that date. Moir was a member of the firm, Reid, 
Moir and Mac Arthur, which carried on a saltpetre refinery during the 
thirties. Moir remained on years after the dissolution of the firm. In 
184(3- he was still residing on this spot. 

The ground covered by the new Police Lines, and the space behind 
them up to the Ganges, contained mast of the bungalows of the cavalry 
officers. The land is now under cultivation for the most part, or waste 
land along the Ganges, covered with fragments of brick and pottery, 
little other evidence of these old houses will be found on the spot. With 
the aid of the records of the Settlement of Land Revenue in 1833, it has 
been possible to mark their position exactly on the map. The village 
belonged originally to Kurmis, and in 1777 when the Cavalry Lines were 
set up, the land became re venue free. In 1805 the cavalry left, and the 
major part of the sites of the bungalows fell into the hands of a few 
wealthy traders of Fatehgarh. W. P. Wattle (came out to India in the 
"Oxford," 1786) is described as a wealthy money lender, commission 
agent, and trader. He and his wife Malka Nur Bibi, and Messrs. Tetley 
and Abbot, owned nearly all the Cantonment in Kutra. Abbot has left 
no traces. Of Tetley there is mention only in the correspondence over 
Captain Hawthorne's affair in 1819-20 (see chapter II). Captain 
Hawthorne says in one of his letters that Tetley had two houses in 



215 

Cantonments, which were situated in one compound. Tetley lived in one, 
and Hawthorne took the other teniporai'ily on lease from him. After the 
abandonment of the Cantonment the land should have reverted to its old 
Kurmi owners. The Board of Revenue, however, leased the sites of the 
officers 1 houses to the old chokidars of those houses at a nominal rent. 
Wattle, Tetley, and Abbot were merely recorded as revenue free holders 
of their land. They did not even pay nominal rent. None of these 
revenue free holders, or lessees, were entitled to the proprietary rights. 
It was thought at the investigation during the settlement of 1813 that the 
Board of Revenue had given away the land in this manner by way of 
compensation for losses incurred in 1804 at the time of the Mahratta 
raid. Holkar's men burnt all the bungalows in Kutra, and the ice house 
and pits in addition. As will be seen later the cavalry officers, who were 
occupants of the houses at the time, obtained no compensation for the 
destruction of their furniture. 

Besides the three European traders already mentioned, three or four 
others owned bungalows. Storr, a wealthy indigo broker, and Mac Arthur, 
both invested in purchases of bungalows, vacated in 1805. A name, 
which is not properly written in the records, Frick or Frank, is entered 
for one. Another house was owned by one Scott, or the word might 
represent " Mess Kot" in the Urdu transliteration. Scott is the better 
reading, since officers' messes could not have been in existence in 1805. 
In one Urdu list occurs "Bailey." There is, however, no record of a 
" Bailey " at any period up to the Mutiny. There were in all nine 
bungalows, including that of Mr. Moir, and two flat roofed houses, or 
kothis, in this part of the Cantonment. In 1804 it is known that the 
fourteen officers of the 4th Regiment of Native Cavalry lived here in ten 
bungalows. On the bank of the Ganges are still to be seen the ruins of 
an old building. This was the " Karbela" built by the Bibi of Mr. 
Newnham. There are several graves in the vicinity, and she is probably 
buried in one of them. Stretching over the land, which runs from the 
boundary of the new Police Lines to the Cawnpore Road, was a large 
enclosure, the use of which is unknown. It was connected with the 
Cavalry Lines in some fashion. 



216 

North of the Rakha Road the land is broken and seamed by nullahs. 
The Marquis of Hastings approached Fatehgarh by this road in 1815. 
He made the following entry in his journal about this very feature, " As 
we approached this place (Fatehgarh) I was much struck with it. The 
whole plain, wherever the eye can reach, is covered with luxuriant crops. 
Numerous and large groves of mango trees break the uniformity of the 
scene, and those at a distance form a rich background to it. The part 
immediately close to the Cantonment is an exception to this statement. It 
is broken in an extraordinary manner by small ravines, not running in any 
general direction, but forming the most confused map of intersections 
imaginable. This tract is of course uncultivated, and nothing can present 
a more arid sterility than its face. It affords protection to the Canton- 
ment, for cavalry cannot approach but by the roads on all of which are 
narrow passes. '' 

The Cavalry Lines commenced at the point of intersection of the 
Cawnpore and Rakha Roads, running parallel to the latter road, and 
covering the areas of the District Jail and the Rakha Mission. They 
lasted from 1777 to 1811, when the Cantonment officially came to an end. 
Two years later Colonel Rutledge gained possession of the Lines, which 
had been deserted since 1805, and leased them out to cultivators for 
Rs. WO yearly. 

The parade ground has an even older history. In the eighteenth 
century the Hangash Nawabs had here a hunting preserve ; and the word 
" Rakha " from rakhna, to preserve, indicates the use to which this area 
was put. In nineteenth century records this parade ground is indifferently 
styled the cavalry or the artillery ground. It was, however, nearly always 
used by the former corps. 

The proceedings of the Governor-General, dated the 4th August 
1777, ordered the establishment of three cavalry regiments of 480 
troopers each, and consequently the Temporary Brigade had attached to 
it the 1st Cavalry under Captain Wray, the 2nd undar Captain Webber, 
and the 3rd under Ciptain Fairfax. Fach regiment, in addition to the 
Captain commanding it, hid two Lieutenants, and there was an adjutant 
and a quartermaster for the corps of cavalry. All these officers were 



217 

borrowed from the infantry battalions, there being no separate cadre of 
officers for the cavalry at this date. The Quartermaster was Ensign 
Lawrence Gall, whose son, George Herbert Gall, was bom at Fatehgarh 
on the 7th February 1779. This is the first birth of which record has 
been found. Lawrence Gall died at Calcutta in 1806 and his son at 
Karnal in 1826, being then Lieut.-Colonel of the 8th Lt. Cavalry. One 
of these regiments, the 1st Cavalry, had been raised some months before 
by Captain Marsack near Farrukhabad City, and contained numbers of 
Kaimganj Pathans. It was, therefore, already on the spot. The other 
two marched in from distant stations, the 2nd coming from Benares. 

It has been seen in Chapter I that Captain Primrose Thompson laid 
out the Fatehgarh Cantonment. His correspondence makes no mention of 
cavalry lines; but from a report of the 19th May 1778, the Lines are 
stated to be in rear of those of the infantry corps, and still later reports 
point to them at Rakha with the transport of the Temporary Brigade 
further to the south at Gaukhana. The description is a very rough one, 
but it must be remembered that at that date the whole area between the 
Fort and Rakha was an open plain wit i none of the abundant vegetation 
which exists a present. Fatehgarh Town, which lies between the Lines 
of the infantry and the cavalry, was then a small bazar of huts to which 
the men of both corps resorted for buying necessaries. The Lines at 
Rakha would have been visible to the infantry to the north of them, and 
the description of the cavahy as being cantoned in the rear would have 
been a natuial one for a resident in the Fatehgarh Cantonment. In 1778 
these lines consisted of 27 hutments for three regiments. The hutments 
were at first of a temporary character. They were merely rows of posts, 
made of mango tree wood, driven into the ground, and supporting roofs 
of thatch. Some portions of the stables were rebuilt, and the horse stalls 
were covered by tiled roofs, supported on masonry pillars ; but thatched 
stalls persisted in use for many years, and gave rise to constant complaint. 
The first temporary stables were erected in December 1777. On the 19th 
May 1778 they were blown down by high winds. They were damaged by 
fire on the 11th March 1795, and hardly had they been repaired, when a 
furious storm on the 15th May blew the thatch off three huts and nearly 



218 

demolished the remainder of the horse stalls. Even so late as 1797, after 
20 years of occupation, nearly all the stables were thatched, and large 
sums of money were being spent on annual repairs. At the end of 1804 
Holker and a Mahratta force raided Fatehgarh and burnt the Lines with 
no difficulty at all. 

Other buildings mentioned as being in the Lines are the store rooms, 
a bungalow on the right of the Lines for two sergeants attached to the 
cavalry, and the European Hospital, the site of which is not discoverable. 
In 1795 the bungalows of two sergeant-majors were in existence, and in 
the following year a bungalow was built for the Hiding Master and two 
sergeants at a cost of 1,000 sicca rupees. 

A bungalow was situated to the south of the Jail facing the parade 
ground. It belonged to Mr. Frick, and was called the Head Sahib's 
house. At the north-western corner of the Jail, a large flat roofed house 
overlooked the race course up to the Mutiny. It was called after Major- 
General Thomas Brown, who commanded the 2nd Cavalry at Fatehgarh 
in 1802. Four years before he seems to have been serving with the 1st 
Cavalry. The house was known for forty years as Colonel Brown's house. 
In 1827 the compound was put under cultivation. It was bought even- 
tually by Nawab Hakim Mehdi Ali Khan. The compound measured 316 
by 265 yards and contained forty trees. The house fell into ruins during 
the Mutiny. Apart from the race course there is only one relic of the old 
Cantonment to be seen to-day. A few hundred yards from the western wall 
of the Mission Girls' School stands a very fine masonry well in the middle 
of a field. This well still does good service, and is worth inspection. 

Four years after the setting up of the Cantonment at Hak ha, the 
cavalry establishment had been reduced to one regiment, namely the 2nd 
Cavalry under Captaiu Law. In 1785 this regiment was under the 
command of Captain Richard Frith, who on and off was stationed at 
Rakha for the next twenty years. Captain Frith (1756-1819) was a 
Cornet in 1779, and appears in the 1st Regiment of Cavalry in 1787. 
He saw active service during the Mud War of 1803. That year he raised 
an Irregular Cavalry Regiment, called the " Hindoostany Independent 
Regiment"; but in the 2nd Mahratta War he was with the 4th Native 



219 

•Cavalry, as will be seen later. From 1815 to his death in 1819 he 
commanded the Agra and Muttra frontier, and was Colonel of the 8th 
Native Cavalry. He died at Muttra, and was buried in the Cantonment 
cemetery at that place. Being an officer with great local knowledge of 
Fatehgarh, he presided over many committees, and his reports exist in 
the records. One of the most interesting records is a memorial, dated 
the 30th November 1804, which was addressed to the Commander-in- 
Chief, Lord Lake, by Major Frith and the officers of the 4th Regiment 
of Native Cavalry from their camp near Muttra. It will be remembered 
that on the 16th November, a fortnight before the drafting of this 
memorial, Holkar and the Mahrattas escaped from Lord Lake's forces, 
and raided Fatehgarh. The Rakha Cantonment, lying as it does near 
to Dhilawal village, where the Mahrattas had their camp, was completely 
ruined as well as the ice house and pits. The object of the memorial was 
to obtain compensation from Government for the destruction of bungalows 
and furniture on that occasion. It is signed by Major Frith, two 
captains, Jive lieutenants, and six cornets of the 4th Cavalry. A list of 
the bungalows is given, which shews the extent of the Cantonment in 
1804. The total loss was estimated at Rs. 29,900. Major Frith and 
his nephew, Captain Elliott, lived together in a large house worth 
Rs. 4,000. Books, furniture and liquors were valued at Rs. 2,000. Two 
brothers, named Lieutenants Charles and Edward Ridge, lived in separate 
houses, apparently in one compound, the two being valued together at 
Rs. 3,000. Their furniture and liquors were worth Rs. 1,000. Captain 
Armstrong had the largest bungalow, worth Rs. 5,000, but had very 
little furniture in it; whilst Lieutenant Shubrick was content with a 
small residence and a large stock of liquor. His furniture was valueless, 
and he made no claim for it. The fourteen officers lived in ten bungalows, 
a number which with the three for the Riding Master and Sergeants 
accords with that given in the records of the first regular Settlement of 
Land Revenue. There is no mention of a regimental mess, and no such 
institution is anywhere recorded for Fatehgarh until 1846. 

On the 25th July 1805 the Secretary to Government in the Military 
Department, who had received the memorial from the Com wander-in- 



220 

Chief, asked the Advocate-General to report. On the 1st August the 
latter replied that the officers had no legal claim. This decision was not 
communicated to the memorialists, and after vainly waiting for two years, 
Lt.-Colonel Frith again wrote to Government at Calcutta. Government 
this time replied that reference would be made to the Court of Directors 
of the East India Company in England for orders, and there the matter 
ended. 

The 1st Regiment of Cavalry spent thirteen years at Rakha, and 
the 2nd Regiment about seventeen years altogether. The history of both 
regiments was uneventful. In 1799 one troop of the 1st Regiment under 
Lieutenant G. H Gall was detached on special duty to Jaipore to assist at 
the arrest of the rebel Vizier Ali and bring him to Fatehgarh. Vizier AM 
was wonted for the murder of the Resident at Benares. Lieutenant John 
Pester in his diary mentions visiting Rakha in June 1805. He dined 
there with the officers of the 27th Light Dragoons. This regiment had 
a year before been away on service with Lord Lake's flying column, and 
returning in pursuit of Holkar, took part in the fight under the City 
walls near the present Farrukhabad Railway Station. The Cantonment's 
existence after Holkar' s raid was with one exception peaceful. On the 
24th May 1805 a tremendous storm ravaged the neighbourhood. Many 
houses in the City fell, and over forty persons were killed there. After 
their abolition officially in 1811 the stable lines and bungalow compounds 
were leased out to cultivators, but the parade ground remained intact. 
In later years cavalry regiments are frequently reported as camping on 
the parade ground. In December 1827 the 3rd Irregular Horse 
(Baddeley's) was in camp on the race course, and in the following year the 
2nd Local (Gardner's) Horse, commanded by Lt.-Colonel R. F. Dougan, 
and known at that time as Dougan's Corps of Irregular Horse. The 
parade ground finally disappeared after 1840, being leased to the Mission, 
which only a few years ago severed all connection with it. It still retains 
its original shape, and is bounded by the remains of the race course. 

The cavalry rifle range was in Naukhandn village, one mile south 
of the present District Jail. The cantonment area, in fact, extended 
some way down the Cawnpore Road and on both sides of it. Four miles 



221 

away were the transport lines, and the village of Lain Gaukhana (Bullock 
Lines) preserves their memory in its name. 

An " Overseer of Bullocks " was in charge of Gaukhana. The first 
was John Fenny, a gunner of Captain Gordon's company of artillery, who 
worked from 1777 for twenty years. The. Bullock Lines were under 
the control of the Artillery Commandant, and an artilleryman was 
naturally put in charge of them, residing in Rahmatganj close by. Sup- 
plies of bhusa and grain were provided by a contractor, who in 1793 was 
the cause of some considerable trouble. The contractor went to Serauli 
village, which is described as five kos from Gaukhana, and filled a 
number of carts with bhusa. An altercation arose with the villagers, who 
prevented the carts from leaving, and the contractor summoned help 
from Fenner, whose immediate superior officer happened to be Lieu- 
tenant Tho. Staunton (died at Fatehgarh 1805) of the 2nd N. I. 
Lieutenant Staunton sent Fenner off to the spot with an escort of sepoys 
to bring back the carts by force. Fenner was set on by a large crowd of 
the inhabitants of Serauli, and had to open fire, killing one and wounding 
two others of them. On the 26th December 1793 Staunton and Fenner 
were court martialled for disobedience of orders and extortion of bhusa, 
Fenner also behig charged with unnecessarily firing on the villagers. 
They were acquitted, but the Commander-in-Chief ordered reconsideration 
of this verdict. The Court again assembled and adhered to its former 
opinion. The Commander-in-Chief was still dissatisfied, and Staunton 
remained under suspension, the papers of his case being sent to the 
Directors of the Company in Fngland. Meanwhile an incident arising 
out of the case, made some stir at Headquarters in Calcutta. An anony- 
mous correspondent signing himself " A Lost Mutton " wrote an offensive 
letter to the World newspaper commenting on the injustice of the pro- 
ceedings. The Commander-in-Chief was much incensed, and fruitless 
efforts were made to discover the author. 

Hak ha comes into notice on the occasion of the great famine of 
1837-38, which was so severe as to necessitate special arrangements by 
Government. It has been said that this was the first occasion on which 
the modern system of relief operations was undertaken. Lord Auck- 



222 

land came to visit the famine area in January 1838; and Miss Eden 
in her " Up Country " letters, as well as Mrs, Fanny Parks, describe the 
scenes of misery through which they passed. Castaway infants and 
children were found in such numbers as to move the compassion of one of 
the officers of the 34th N. I . , then quartered at Fatehgarh. Captain 
Wheeler voluntarily set about collecting them; and thus was formed the 
nucleus of the Fatehgarh Orphanage, Captain Wheeler, being trans- 
ferred, handed over his charges to the Rev. H. Wilson, an American 
missionary, who came on the scene in 1838 with 48 orphans from 
Fatehpore, where an orphanage had been broken up He received 45 
from Captain Wheeler; and it was decided that a self-supporting insti- 
tution should be set up at Fatehgarh. 

Rakha holds a preeminent place in the history of the missions in 
North India. Unfortunately the story of its foundation has not been 
told in detail, and it is difficult to disentangle its organisation from that 
of the other settlement at Barhpur. An account is to be found in a book 
called " The History of the American Presbyterian Missions in India", 
published in 1886, which is so condensed as to make it impossible to 
follow the development of the two mission stations at Fatehgarh step by 
step. It appears that the first missionaries to reach Fatehgarh were 
Messrs Newton and Wilson at the end of October 1835, when on 
their way to Ludhiana. They visited the City, and were much pleased 
with their reception there. It was realised that Fatehgarh would be 
a good centre for missionary work. In 1837 Mr. H. R. Wilson was 
appointed to go from Allahabad, and commence work at Farrukha- 
l&gt;ad. Actually he arrived at Rakha in November of the next year with 
the Fatehpur orphans, and in August 1839 Mr. J. L. Scott joined him 
The orphans then numbered 109, and an instructor being imported from 
Mirzapore District, carpet-weaving was started as an industry for 
them. The Barhpur Mission on the Lai Gate Road must have come into 
existence this year; for although the history of the Mission in India, 
quoted above, is not clear on the point, the local district records 
mention the Mission High School at Barhpur as being actively at work 
in 1839. 



228 

' The Rakha Mission took a step forward in 1840, when it became 
independent of Allahabad. Two mission houses and the orphanage 
building were erected during the next year, and there were further additions 
to the staff. Messrs. Rankin and McAuley and Miss Vandervecr arrived, 
though there is nothing to show whether they worked at Rakha, or at 
Barhpur. The importance of the local mission stations was recognised 
abroad. The General Assembly of the United States constituted the 
Farrukhabad Presbytery along with those of Ludhiana and Allahabad, 
the three being ordered to meet together as the Synod of North India. 
This new constitution was promulgated in May 1841 ; and the first Synod 
ever held in India met at Rakha in the small chapel at the Mission four 
years after, Barhpur at this time was insignificant in comparison, but 
it probably had a larger staff of missionaries, who were then engaged 
in expanding the High School and numerous primary schools in the 
vicinity of the City. In 1845 Government gave up its High School 
in Farrukhabad, the furniture and building being transferred to the 
Mission. 

The Rakha settlement was most thriving in 1845. Soon after their 
arrival Mr. Wilson and Mr. Scott applied to Government for a lease of 
the old Cavalry Lines and part of the parade ground to the west of the 
race course, which was then lying waste. Negotiations were completed 
in 1840. The Mission acquired 124 acres on a yearly rental of Rs. 60. 
Two bungalows, a school, an orphanage building, an industrial building, 
a small village, and a chapel were set up. The industrial establishment 
made great strides. The manufacture of carpets had been begun by the 
orphans with great skill, and soon after 18J39 it was reported that their 
industry could not cope with the demand. To car pet-weaving was added 
the business of tent-making in 1844 " chiefly to secure employment and 
business for the rising colony of married orphans." From 1844 to 1846 
tents to the value of Rs. 60,672 had been made by the Orphan Asylum 
and sold to the public. The subsequent history of the tent factory 
indicates the great repute, which it had acquired. Before 1857 the 
Mission supplied the management, but after the Mutiny the converts 
formed themselves into a limited company and became independent. By 



224 

1875 the company was paying 524 per cent dividends, and hati added art 
indigo factory to its. concern. 

Mr. J.J. Walsh took in hand the project of building a church, and 
in 1856 the present structure was completed. Maharaja Dhuleep Singh 
subscribed Rs. 500 towards the building, and it is noteworthy that the 
various primary schools at and around the City were carried on by the 
Mission largely by the help of his donations. Just before the Mutiny the 
Rakha Mission was able to point with pride to the accomplishment of a 
well planned mission station, carrying on work of the highest value 
through its civilising agency. Some notable personalities of the American 
Presbyterian Mission had worked there, including Gopinath Nande, the 
first Indian to be ordained for work in the Mission. The Christian 
village, founded on the parade ground behind the Mission, was one of the 
first of its kind. The cemetery to the west of the Mission, which can be 
seen behind high walls by the side of the main road, is pre-Mutiny. The 
first missionary buried there was Mrs. Seeley in J 853- Mr. Walsh on 
his departure to America in 1856 was able to leave the Rakha Mission in 
a most flourishing condition, and largely as the result of his own labours. 
Within a year of his leaving the place was in ruins. The mutineers in 
J857 made havoc of the Mission. The bungalows, factory, and the village 
were laid in ruins. Only the walls and spire of the Church were left 
standing. Messrs. J. E. Freeman and R. McMullin, who were the 
missionaries then in charge, perished with their families at Cawnpore 
after escaping from Fatehgarh iu the boats. The Mission premises were 
restored by Mr. Fullerton, who was sent by the Mission from Agra for 
the purpose. 

There is nothing further of note along this road. On the site of the 
Central Jail was the bungalow of a Sergeant Superintendent of the road, 
probably a person on the Invalid Establishment. The road was from the 
earliest times important; for it was the high road to Mainpuri, and pro- 
vided with staging bungalows at Sakwai, Madanpur and other places. In 
1794, Twining found it extremely bad and covered with deep sand. It 
was metalled in the forties. There was a bridge of boats over the Kali 
Nadi at Madanpur from 1854.
