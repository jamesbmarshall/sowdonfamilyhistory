<p><font face="Arial">(Extract from my Great Grandfather, Harry Wilson Sowdon's dairy). </font></p>

<blockquote>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">
Here I might mention that Mr Wilson Lomer was a native of Southampton and a 
member of a family long connected with that town and the county of Hampshire, he 
had been left ample means which he improved by trade but retired early in life 
and after his daughter Louisa's marriage came to live in Reading at Wilton House 
in the King's Road nearly opposite Swiss Villa in the year 1847. His wife who 
was rather infirm was crossing the road on Castle Hill when a coach and four 
horses ran over her and she died of the injuries. Mr Lomer her husband took the 
matter to heart and said, &quot;I shall not live very long&quot;, he was then 72, &quot;but I 
will give&quot; he said to his daughters, &quot;each of you your fortune then you will not 
wish for my death and I will buy an annuity&quot;. He gave them each £30,000 which he 
settled on them and their children as they should by will appoint and bought an 
annuity of 1,200 a year in the Norwich Life Assurance Co and a Government 
annuity, he lived to enjoy that from the year 1847 to the year 1877, a period of 
30 years. He was 72 when he insured and 102 when he died, after the death of his 
daughter Mrs Sowdon. He went to live at Bayswater in London and his other 
daughter Mrs Caird and her husband Dr Caird of Exeter who had just retired from 
business came to live with him. He kept his health until the age of 102 and used 
to walk out by himself but got very deaf and almost blind, he had, however, a 
great objection to any one going with him, and would if he could get away by 
himself, he went out one day unbeknown to his daughter to make some little 
purchases for Christmas and in crossing the road was knocked down by a cart and 
broke his thigh. He lingered for about 6 months bedridden but the bone would not 
unite and he died at last from exhaustion, he is buried in a vault with his wife 
in Reading Cemetery just opposite the grave of his daughter and son-in-law, 
Louisa and Harry Sowdon.<br>
<br>
He went after he came to London to live, to the head Office of the Norwich 
Assurance Co. for his annuity himself, but when he was 100 years of age the 
Company refused to pay him alleging that he could not be 100 looking so well and 
healthy and that he must have given a wrong age on entering, he was very 
indignant and said he had never been accused of such a thing be and he should 
never come to the Office again to be insulted or ever ask them himself for the 
money and he took no further steps in the matter but the Rev. White of Weyhead 
then who had also insured Mr Lomer's life in the same Company took steps to get 
the certificate again of his baptism and sent it to the Office, of course they 
at once paid the demands.<br>
<br>
When Mr White some time afterwards came to London to see Mr Lomer he said I am 
obliged to you for getting my annuity paid, I did not intend to trouble about it, 
at my age one does not want to be worried, it's worry that kills, I can do 
without it and I had made of my mind not to be troubled with any business, but 
you are one of my executors and I gave directions in my will that you should see 
that the Norwich Life Co. paid up all arrears and 5 per cent interest, but you 
have seen to it before and any expense you have been put to, I shall be pleased 
to pay; showing that Mr Lomer still kept all his faculties. When he was 100 he 
gave a birthday party and after dinner he returned thanks to the company present 
for drinking his health saying in the course of his speech that he felt very 
well and hoped that he should meet them all on his 200th birthday. He left most 
of his money to his surviving daughter Mrs Caird, she lived about 6 months after 
her father and dying without a will it came to her husband Dr Caird and left it 
at his death to his three children, young Dr Caird, Mrs Southby of Newbury, wife 
of Mr Southby a partner in the Bank at Newbury and member of a very ancient 
Berkshire family, (spoken of further in this book) and another daughter Mrs 
Oliver.<br>

(A photograph of Wilson Lomer exists, taken around 1856 when Wilson Lomer was 
already 86 years of age. The photograph is in reasonable condition considering 
its age, having been found stuck face down in the diary of Harry Wilson Sowdon 
for some considerable time. It is hoped to restore the photograph to some of its 
original condition.)</font></p>
