<H4 class="auto-style2">Major Charles Marsack</H4>
<p class="auto-style12"><strong>Born:</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style12"><strong>Died: 6 Nov 1820</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style12"><strong>Married: 31 Oct 1783 Charlotte Becher at Epsom, 
Surrey, England.</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style12"><strong>Parents: Frederick Ludwig of Hanover, Prince of 
Wales and Comtesse Margaret de Marsac(k)</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style12">
<span class="auto-style1">

<span class="auto-style7">

<strong>Charles was the illegitimate son of Frederick 
Ludwig (Louis), Prince of Wales and Margaret, Countess of Marsac(k). In April 
1786, Thomas Jefferson, the future third President of the United States, visited 
Caversham Park and other places described in Whately's treatise in search of 
inspirations for his own gardens at Monticello and other architectural projects. 
An astute observer, Jefferson's account in his Notes of a Tour of English 
Gardens reads like this:&quot;Caversham Park near Reading in Berkshire was owned by 
Charles Marsack: &quot;Caversham. Sold by Ld. Cadogan to Majr. Marsac. 25. as. of 
garden, 400. as. of park, 6 as. of kitchen garden. A large lawn, separated by a 
sunk fence from the garden, appears to be part of it. A straight broad gravel 
walk passes before the front and parallel to it, terminated on the right by a 
Doric temple, and opening at the other end on a fine prospect. This straight 
walk has an ill effect. The lawn in front, which is pasture, well disposed with 
clumps of trees.&quot;</strong></span></span></p>
<h1>The Mysterious Nabob - Charles Marsack<o:p></o:p></h1>
<p class="auto-style11">The man who appeared so opportunely to buy the Caversham 
estate from Lord Cadogan<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" title=""><span class="auto-style13"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[1]</span><![endif]></span></span></a> 
in 1783 remains the most enigmatic figure ever to be associated with it. He is 
known as Major Marsac, of Marsack and like many rich men of that era, he had 
served in the East India Company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
He is said to have bought Caversham over lunch with Cadogan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It would be interesting to know the sum he gave for it, but 
correspondence or documents throwing light on this do not appear to be 
available. On his death thirty-seven years later, his real estate is said to 
have been valued at &pound;107,000 and as this consisted almost entirely of the 
Caversham estate, it may be assumed, even though land values rose during the 
period, that the price he paid for it was very substantial, probably in the 
neighbourhood of Â£100,000.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">With Charles Marsack, we enter on perhaps the most 
extraordinary phase in the long history of the Caversham estate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lord Cadogan, certainly no great figure in the hall of fame, but at least<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>placeable in the political and social spheres of his time, suddenly 
divests himself of this fine house and estate, and into his shoes there steps 
this shadowy personage about whose origins and history his contemporaries seem 
to have been almost as uncertain as we are today. They knew he was rich and 
personable, and what they called an East Indian that is, a man who had spent 
his time in the service of the East India Company and who might therefore be 
assumed to have the characteristics of the opulent exile, vulgar ostentation and 
impatience of opposition. But beyond this, I the publications of the time are 
any guide, they were completely in the dark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If his neighbours, with all the popular prejudice against the behaviour 
of returned Nabobs, were prepared in advance to dislike his ways, they were not 
disappointed. As early as 1784 - the year after his purchase of Caversham- we 
find the Public Advertiser criticising him for guarding his land against 
trespassers with unwonted strictness.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"His Lordship 
(Cadogan) suffered any person to pass through his Park, but now you must pay or 
'tis back again!"<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">It continued in sarcastic strain about the number and 
type of the large band of retainers Marsack had brought with him to Caversham.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>"The homely rustic 
	
blushing maid are now supplanted by old French women, Swiss Valets-de-w, Black 
boys' Gentoo coachmen, Mulatto footmen, and negro butlers. The dialect is of 
course improved much - through here and there the plain English is retained -  
but it is only to make mistakes - for they call Mr. Marsac - a very worthy East 
Indian - Major Massacre - and his improvements, his devastation."<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Who was this exotic stranger whose arrival in the quiet 
countryside near Reading caused the surprise and distaste reflected in the 
"Public Advertiser"? The name Marsack is absent from every major work of 
reference except Burke's Landed Gentry (1937 edition). There, he is said to have 
traced his descent from "the French family of the De Marsac, through Count De 
Marsac, who left France during the Huguenot dispersion and became attached to 
the Court of Hanover, with which he came over to England in 1719." Burke says 
that Major Marsack was the grandson of the Count De Marsac, but makes no mention 
of his father. The fact is that the editors of Burke were probably working 
largely in the dark, as every researcher must who deals with the problem of this 
family. The assertion that Marsack was descended from a Huguenot refugee Comte 
de Marsac, who was attached to the Court of Hanover and came thence to England 
with that court, is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to substantiate. 
Search as one will, high and low, in the records and publications of the period, 
official or otherwise - or indeed of any subsequent period - it is impossible, 
it would seem, to find any reference whatever to a Comte de Marsac - let alone 
to one who came to England in 1719 with the Court of Hanover. And this applies 
not only to English records and publications, but to those in Paris and Hanover. 
It is also stated in Burke that the Comte's widow Margaret, appears to have 
married one Holcroft, whom it does not identify, and to have died in 1785. Here 
again, there is no evidence in any traceable record or publications for the 
existence in England at the time of any Comtesse de Marsac, although a woman 
named Margaret Marsack certainly married a man called John Holcroft (or 
Houlcroft) in 1754, according to the register of St George's Chapel, Mayfair, a 
church notorious for the celebration of clandestine weddings - and died in 1785, 
according to the burial register of St Marylebone Parish Church.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">So much for the present, for Major Marsack's ancestors, 
but what of the man himself? The only ascertainable references to his origins 
and career, apart from a few letters in "Notes and Queries", occur in Hodson'<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" title=""><span class="auto-style13"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[2]</span><![endif]></span></span></a>s 
"List of Officers of the Bengal Army, 1758 - 1834", and in the National Army 
Museum at Sandhurst. These sources tell the same tale, and are probably derived, 
as far as their genealogical details are concerned, from a single original 
source - the Marsack family records which have remained private. The story which 
emerges is that Charles Marsack, born in 1736, was the natural son of Frederick 
Louis, Prince of Wales, father of George III , by Marguerite, Comtesse de 
Marsac. The bare fact of his parentage is recorded, and there is nothing to show 
where he was born of what his upbringing and education were. Once again, too, 
the annals of the period are devoid of anything which might corroborate the 
assertion of royal paternity. Nor do Prince Frederick Louis' several biographers 
so much as mention the name Marsack, although they deal with the subject of his 
mistresses and illegitimate offspring in some detail. Both the Prince's father , 
George II, and his grandfather, George I, were notorious for the number of their 
mistresses, one lady of seemingly perennial charm is reputed to have been the 
mistress of all three royal gentlemen in turn, and were certainly not 
particularly concerned about hiding the identity of their natural children. 
Prince Frederick's own illegitimate son by Miss Vane, a court lady, was given 
the surname FitzFrederick. Such royal liaisons were common enough, and open 
enough, during the reigns of the first two Georges.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Why then, if the Prince of Wales was in fact Major 
Marsack's father, the apparent lack of any evidence pointing to this? The fact 
of such parentage once granted, the complete absence of any allusion to it in 
contemporary records and publications, or in the private correspondence of the 
time, is only explicable on the assumption of a conspiracy of silence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The motive for a conspiracy so curious, if conspiracy there were, may 
perhaps be found in the nature of the terms on which Prince Frederick Louis 
lived with his parents, King George II and Queen Caroline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Prince's biographers, though varying considerably in their estimates 
of his character, unanimously admit that he was hated by his father and despised 
by his mother and draw attention to their wish to exclude his from the 
succession to the throne in favour of his brother, the Duke of Cumberland.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>George II's obsessive aversion to the Prince seems to have taken the form 
of doubting, or affecting to doubt, whether Frederick was really his child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Queen Caroline, if Lord Hervey, her closest confidant is to be believed, 
appears to have been convinced, or wished to be convinced, that her eldest son 
was impotent, so bitter was her contempt for him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the first child - a daughter - of his marriage to Princess Augusta 
of Saxe-Gotha was about to be born in 1737 - the year after the birth of Charles 
Marsack - the Prince at the last moment hurried his wife away from Hampton Court 
in the greatest secrecy,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and the 
birth took place at St James' Palace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was unwilling that the Princesses' delivery should take place in the 
palace where the King and Queen were in residence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One biographer even suggests that he feared for the child's life such was 
the obsessive hatred of his parents for their heir.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, the first words uttered by the King, when roused by Queen 
Caroline in the middle of the night to be informed of the event, betray the 
extraordinary atmosphere of suspicion and morbid loathing which hag-rid the 
royal couple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They also reflect the 
predicament of the head of a house which had been so loose-living for three 
generations that doubt about the paternity of royal children became an automatic 
reflex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>George II is reported - 
again on the authority of Hervey, who had it from Queen Caroline - to have 
bellowed:<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"You see now, with all your wisdom, how they have outwitted 
you!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is all your fault.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is a false child which will be put upon you, and how will you 
answer it to all your children?"<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Queen Caroline's behaviour is no less significant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She drove off at once to London, with a party of five, including her two 
elder daughters, and hurried to St James' Palace to make a personal inspection 
of mother and child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This seems to 
have satisfied her that no question of the introduction of a changeling, or some 
other trickery, was involved, for on the return journey she burst out:<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"Well, upon my honour, I no more doubt this poor little bit 
of a thing is the Princesses' child than I doubt of either of these two being 
mine, though I own to you I had my doubts upon the road that there would be some 
juggle; and if instead of this poor little ugly she-mouse, there had been a 
brave, large, fat, jolly boy, I should I should not have been cured of my 
suspicions."<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">It is noteworthy that the Queen's doubts at first seem 
to have turned upon whether the Princess had in fact had a child at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Once she had satisfied herself of this, all her emphasis was upon the sex 
and identity of the child, since upon this depended the royal succession.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">To be able to form an opinion on this matter, it is 
necessary to understand what the Prince's own marriage aspirations had been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His earliest love was the woman his parents had intended him to marry 
when they first began to plan a dynastic alliance for him - Princess Wilhelmina 
of Prussia.. He had become thoroughly attached to her when his father became 
involved in a quarrel - over some minor royal interest - with hers, and forced 
him to abandon the idea of marriage to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Frederick, it would appear, never forgave his father for this - even 
attempting to arrange a secret marriage with Wilhelmina at the last moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And by Walpole - involving a plan for a secret marriage to the old 
Duchess of Marlborough's granddaughter, Lady Diana Spencer, who was to bring 
with her a portion of Â£100,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
Then, and rather suddenly, came the announcement of the Prince's engagement to 
Princess Augusta, and with it there came provision for a much increased 
allowance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why did Frederick, who 
had seemed happy enough to procrastinate over any matrimony sponsored by his 
parents, decide to take the plunge?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
And why did the King, who seemingly abominated the idea of his eldest-born's 
coming to the throne, suddenly acquiesce in a royal alliance for him, giving him 
added publicity thereby and marking him out as the vehicle of succession?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why after the birth of the first child of this alliance, with its strange 
attendant circumstances, did the King banish the Prince of Wales from his 
presence, and address him in a series of public rebukes and proscriptions so out 
of proportion with the offence that Sir Robert Walpole, the Prime Minister, was 
forced to explain the matter in a secret conclave to Lord Hardwicke, the Lord 
Chancellor, who thereafter proved unwilling to disclose what he had been told, 
to anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All he says in his 
diary, that Walpole had informed him of "certain passages between the King and 
himself, and between the Queen and the Prince of too high a secret a nature even 
to be trusted to this narrative."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
What extraordinary information could this have been which so effectively sealed 
the lips of all concerned?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sir 
George Young, one of the Prince's biographers, believes that it may have 
concerned, "the royal resolution to cut the Prince out of the succession".
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>But surely, if such a resolution had in 
fact actually been taken by the King, he must have imparted to Walpole his 
reasons for wishing to take as step of so momentous a nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These would have to be of the weightiest kind - for the Prince could 
hardly be removed on the grounds that he had chosen to have his child born at St 
James' Palace rather than at Hampton Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nor could such charges at addiction to mistresses, or the fathering of 
bastards, come with any force in such an age, or from a monarch so open to 
criticism himself for precisely these weaknesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>King George II must have been as well aware as anyone that efforts to rid 
himself of his son on grounds such as these would get him nowhere with his 
Ministers, or indeed with the British public of that day.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Since Prince Frederick was not in fact deprived of his 
right to succeed, but lived to be the father of George III, and died still the 
heir to the throne during his father's reign, it must be assumed either that 
George II did not attempt to cut him out if the succession, or that he was 
unsuccessful in getting his Ministers' support for such a move.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If he did make the attempt, what kind of change could he have made that 
would have had any chance of success?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Surely one of the most effective would have been the charge of bigamy, or 
the existence of a still valid morganatic<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3" title=""><span class="auto-style13"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[3]</span><![endif]></span></span></a> 
marriage antedating that with Princess Augusta?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is in this context that one should consider the remarks let drop first 
by the King and then by the Queen at the time of the birth of Princess Augusta's 
first child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The King, it will be 
remembered, feared a "false child" being palmed off on them, and the Queen 
admitted to being cured of her suspicions because the child was a little 
"she-mouse" instead of being a "brave, large, fat, jolly boy".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why should the she-mouse be more genuine than the large boy?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The only explanation seemingly fitting the facts is that the Queen 
already knew, or at least suspected, that a boy had been to Prince Frederick, 
and feared that he would attempt to pass him off as the child of himself and 
Princess Augusta, and hence second in succession to the throne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the child, known later as Charles Marsack, had been born in 1736, he 
would already be several months old, and so "brave, large and fat" in comparison 
with the new-born infant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuming 
for the sake of argument that this hypothesis has validity, may it not be that 
at this stage the King and Queen knew, or suspected, more than this, but that 
very very shortly afterwards they discovered that Frederick was indeed the 
father of a male child, which was not illegitimate but the issue of a secret 
morganatic marriage previously contracted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, that they found themselves faced with a situation in 
which the heir to the throne had entered into a bigamous marriage with his royal 
spouse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here surely was a chance 
not only to do their duty as a constitutional ruler and his consort, but a 
golden opportunity to eliminate their hated Frederick from the succession?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why - always<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>granting that 
such an hypothesis has any validity at all - was the opportunity not taken?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The answer surely must be that wily and experienced politician Walpole, 
and wary colleague the Lord Chancellor, would inevitably seek to avoid the 
scandal of such a revelation, with its incalculable political consequences, in 
preference to any other course, and would counsel the burial of this matter in 
the deepest obscurity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And that - 
always remembering that all this is the purest conjecture - is just conceivably 
how the birth and origin of Charles Marsack came to be shrouded in impenetrable 
mystery, as was his whole life until the age of twenty-nine.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">From the quicksands of surmise and supposition, two 
patches of slightly firmer ground emerge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>From information in the possession of the royal library at Windsor 
Castle, it is known that one Charles Marsac was listed for a period of five 
years - from 1742 to 1747 - as "Servant to Mr Zollicoffe (or Zollicoffre), Page 
of the Backstairs to King George II".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing is known of this Mr. Zollicoffe, but the name seems to be of 
Swiss origin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Papers in the 
possession of the Marsack family, of whom there are still descendants living in 
England, New Zealand and elsewhere, are said to confirm Charles Marsack's royal 
descent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But while one branch of 
the family names Prince Frederick as its ancestor, another takes the view that 
Major Marsack's father was George II himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
&nbsp;</span>A lady representing this branch of the Marsacks wrote, in her 
unpublished private history of the family:<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"It would appear that Major Marsack returned to England 
from India to press his claims on George III, and that he was content to receive 
a large sum of money on condition that he should observe strict secrecy 
regarding his birth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His father was 
George II, and his mother the Comtesse de Marsac, and many things point to a 
secret marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Frederick Roome de 
Marsac, a grandson of the Major's, though that documents to prove this are in 
the Royal Archives - but there they will now remain."<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Contemporary members of the Marsack family firmly 
believe in the existence of a Comtesse de Marsac as their ancestress, and the 
present head of the family, a New Zealander, has a miniature said by Frederick 
Roome de Marsac, to be her. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Charles Marsack first emerges from the obscurity of his 
early years at the mature age of twenty nine, when he became a cadet in the 
Honourable East India Company's Bengal Army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The year was 1765 - Prince Frederick had been dead for fourteen years, 
and George II for five; Margaret Marsac - plain Margaret Marsack, unadorned by a 
title - had been married to John Holcroft for eleven years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Walpole and Hardwicke had both passed from the arena of life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Marsack was gazetted as an ensign in the Bengal Army on 3<sup>rd</sup> 
November 1765, and as such he was almost immediately involved in an affair known 
as "the Batta mutiny"<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn4" title=""><span class="auto-style13"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[4]</span><![endif]></span></span></a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The year had been one of great importance in the annals of the East India 
Company - it had seen the grant of Bengal to the Company by the Mogul Emperor, 
and the return of Clive to India after a period of five years at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The great man was back with the mission cleansing the Augean stable of 
Anglo-Indian corruption.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His job 
was to make immediate war on the great volume of private trade carried on by the 
Company's civilian servants, and to enforce retrenchments in military 
expenditure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Officers of the Bengal 
Army had been retiring with fortunes made out of supplying clothing and food to 
the troops, and the batta (the double pay allowed officers when they were on 
active service) had been granted with a freedom, and in circumstances, of which 
the Court of Directors disapproved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
The axe fell on the Bengal Army in 1766, and Marsack, as one of the junior 
officers, who were principally affected, joined in the compact they made to 
resign there commissions en masse with the object of compelling Clive to restore 
the batta allowance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The records 
show that he handed in his commission in May that year, and was reinstated in 
November, when the mutiny collapsed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Within a few months, he had been made a lieutenant in a company of 
artillery belonging to the First Brigade, stationed at Monghyr, on the borders 
of Bihar, and by 1769 he had been appointed Surveyor of the Province of Oudh - a 
curious post for a young lieutenant of artillery to be given.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In 1771, he was promoted Captain, a rank which he still held when he 
finally retired from the service eight years later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Promotion in the artillery was notoriously slow, and brevet rank was 
therefore occasionally granted, and it may be that this was how he came to be 
known as Major Marsack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Little more 
has come down to us about his Indian service, except that he raised one of two 
cavalry regiments for the Nawab Wazir of Oudh in 1776, and commanded it, with 
the rank of major in the Oudh service, till its transfer to the Company the 
following year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1778, he raised 
another regiment, the 31<sup>st</sup> Battalion of Sepoys, but declined the 
command.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>It was clear that by this 
time, after some thirteen years in India, he was beginning to think of returning 
to England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An indication of this 
occurs in Hazlitt's continuation of the autobiography of Thomas Holcroft, the 
dramatist, who it seems was John Holcroft's nephew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In a chapter dealing with Thomas Holcroft's third wife , Dinah Robinson, 
he says, apropos of the period 1778-79, one of great financial stringency for 
Holcroft:<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"At one time great hopes were entertained from the expected 
arrival of a Mr Marsac, a near relation of his wife, who had had a handsome 
appointment in India, and who, in their present situation, it was thought, would 
be willing to assist them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But he 
did not arrive within the time which had been fixed."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Dinah, widow of John Robinson, was in fact Major 
Marsack's half-sister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was John 
Holcroft's daughter by Margaret Marsack and as such Thomas Holcroft's cousin.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">It is not surprising that the Holcrofts were 
disappointed, for Marsack did not return to England until 1783 - four years 
after the expected time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And by 
1786, he had become involved as a hostile witness in the seven-year-long trial 
of Warren Hastings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It emerged 
during his testimony that he had in fact actually resigned his commission in 
1779, but had spent the period 1779-1783 in India trying to get payment of money 
which he claimed was owed him by the Nawab of Oudh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hastings meanwhile had come home from his distinguished career in India, 
as the East India Company's principal administrator and finally as 
Governor-General, only two years after Marsack's own return. He had been 
impeached at the bar of the House of Lords on charges of corruption and cruelty 
- and the hunt was up against him with Burke, Fox and Sheridan leading the 
field.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His acquittal on all charges 
is now a matter of history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the 
outset of the preliminary investigation, Burke, in marshalling his evidence 
against Hastings rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it 
is clear from a letter he wrote in 1788 that he regarded the Major as having a 
personal axe to grind, but was determined to use his testimony, which he had 
found accurate at all points where it could be checked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, Marsack's evidence to the House of Commons lost much of its 
force when it became known that he had a personal grievance against Hastings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For it emerged that he had tried only a short while before to persuade<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hastings to pay over Â£10,383, the sum which he claimed was owing him by 
the Nawab of Oudh and had hinted at legal proceedings in the event of 
non-payment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Marsack's allegation 
in regard to this sum was that Hastings had prevented him from obtaining the 
money while he was in India by recalling him to Bengal at the crucial moment 
when payment could have been made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
He even accused the former Governor-General of ordering a company of sepoys to 
be sent to enforce his departure from Benares, where he had gone on leaving 
Oudh, and boasted that he had succeeded in slipping away before their arrival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Official documents made public at the time of the trial show that 
Hastings had given orders in 1777 for Marsack's removal from the command of the 
cavalry regiment he raised for the Nawab of Oudh, and that he and his Council 
regarded him as one of those English Officers who had turned Lucknow into what 
he called "the school of rapacity", and who were battening upon the revenues of 
the over-pliable Nawab.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
documents also confirm that Hastings ultimately, in 1782, ordered Marsack's 
expulsion from Oudh, although they throw no light on Marsack's complaint that a 
company of sepoys had been sent to see that he left Benares.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Marsack's wife, whom be probably married during these 
years of waiting at the end of his Indian career - was Charlotte, daughter of 
Richard Becher, a famous and respected member of the East India Company, whose 
descendants were associated with the Indian service for generations, one of them 
being the mother of Thackeray the novelist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Charlotte Marsack was very young<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>- possibly no more than seventeen, when Caversham was acquired, and must 
have been very much in the hands of her husband, who was more than thirty years 
her senior. In his new surroundings, the Major, as we have seen, not only caused 
offence by the exotic nature of his large domestic staff, and his desire to 
prevent persons passing through his park, but drew upon himself the wrath of 
Horace Walpole and other connoisseurs of the work of Capability Brown by cutting 
down a number of fine beeches which were such a feature or Brown's landscaping 
in the later Cadogan era at Caversham. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A 
print by Dayes<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn5" title=""><span class="auto-style13"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[5]</span><![endif]></span></span></a>,

specific deed which earned him his nickname "Mr. Massacre"- for Walpole, with 
characteristic malice, even deprives him of his military title.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="auto-style11">The view in this print includes the mansion, seen from 
the south; it appears to be a rather tall rectangular block of nine bays, with 
flanking wings and unbalustraded roof-line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first visitor of who there is record to Caversham Lodge, as it was 
still called in Major Marsack's day, was no less a person than Thomas 
Jefferson, later President of the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was American Minister in Paris at the time, 1786, and was on a tour 
of the more famous gardens in England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was accompanied by John Adams, the Minister in London, destined to 
precede him in the U.S. Presidency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
Garden-designing and architecture were among Jefferson's hobbies, but he had 
little to say about the layout at Caversham.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He comments, rather rapidly: "A large lawn, separated by a sunk fence 
from the gardens, appears to be part of it, and he notes the existence of the 
Doric temple at the western end of the terrace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
	
</span>Surprisingly enough, he has nothing to say about the ornamental waters at 
Caversham, which had been a striking feature of the place at least since the 
days of the first Earl of Cadogan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
At the time of his visit, if contemporary maps are to be believed, the ground to 
the south of the house included three lakes, a feature which he could hardly 
have overlooked.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Another visitor, a Mrs. Sherwood, whose memoirs recall 
that she visited Caversham as a schoolgirl in the early 1790's, writes: "This 
was formerly a most magnificent mansion, in which queens and princesses had been 
entertained.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was much when I 
visited the house to bring India before me, amongst other things a splendid 
tapestry representing a royal cavalcade on a march, with camels and elephants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We were taken before dinner to a hot house, where the Major presented me 
with a Capricum, telling me it was some sort of fine fruit, laughing heartily 
when I put some of it in my mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
He had a delicate young wife and several little children, but I did not envy her 
with all her splendour".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The last 
sentence suggests that the Major had not made a very pleasant impression on his 
visitor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1795, we find him

who, with her husband, kept a diary during their exile in England at this 
period, records this of a London dinner party given by the Marsacks in 1796: "At 
dinner was a very pretty Miss Fox, a friend of Mrs. Marsack. I didn't care about 
her style, nor did I think her looks proper in a young miss.......Dinner went on for 
an extremely long time, and was a really miserable affair; two of the diners 
sang in English, but so drearily that one might have thought oneself in church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Mrs. Marsack is a very sweet woman; she has arranged for me to stay with 
her in the country next summer."<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Another entry in the diary, for 20<sup>th</sup> June 
1796, reports: <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"The Princess de Craon has told them (friends called

that she is with Bonne at Caversham,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>at Major Marsack's, and that he, always bad-tempered, gave them a bad 
reception."<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Finally, early in 1797, the diary informs us that the 
Major's little French governess had heard from her uncle that he had been able 
to save enough of his fortune to make her a modest allowance, and that she 
hurried to Mrs. Marsack and announced that she was going to leave her. Her 
relief at being able to leave the household of the bad-tempered Major was no 
doubt genuine; but it is nice to know, from a diary entry some three weeks 
later, that relations were still friendly, and that the Major had called at Mme. 
Danloux's to invite her to the opera with. Bonne d'Alpy and Miss Fox.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear from the Danloux diary that such members of the exiled French 
nobility as the Duc de Bourbon, the Duc de Mortemart, and the Princesse de Craon 
were to be found among the Marsack's visitors at this period.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Major Marsack had passed his sixtieth birthday in 1796, 
and by this time he and his wife must have had a whole houseful of children to 
look after.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His own five sons and 
three daughters were not his only responsibility;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>his half-sister, Margaretta - daughter of John Holcroft and Margaret 
Marsack (or the Comtesse de Marsac) - and her husband, William Roome, had both 
died young, and Charles Marsack had taken their three small boys to live with 
him at Caversham Lodge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All three 
were older than their Marsack cousins, the youngest being thirteen in 1796.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Major kept them at Caversham until each in turn was old enough to go 
into the East India Company"s Bombay Army, where in due course they all became 
generals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their adoption by their 
uncle must have transformed their lives and their prospects, for. Charles 
Marsack, in spite of the mystery of his origin, had been made High Sheriff Of 
Oxfordshire within a few years of his coming to live at Caversham, and was 
Deputy Lieutenant of thee county for nearly He whole of his life there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, he was not only rich, but influential, and in Caversham, he 
possessed one of the finest estates in Oxfordshire - a place to be described, on 
its offer for sale some thirty years later, as "one of the most distinguished 
seats in England".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if one 
allows for some exaggeration in the estate agent's puff, and for the fact that 
it was made subsequent to the very costly embellishments to the mansion of the 
early 1820s, there can be no doubt that Caversham, for situation and beauties of 
its park and grounds, was highly rated by connoisseurs of the late eighteenth 
and early nineteenth centuries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
Lord Harcourt, an Oxfordshire magnate, had written of it, in December 783,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>hat it was "much too fine a place to be passed over unnoticed, 
particularly as the approach to the house from London road is universally 
allowed to surpass in beauty and variety everything. Comparable off the kind."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mrs. Lybbe-Powys,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>a devoted 
admirer, who as a neighbour was able to visit the place frequently, thought that 
the terrace on the south side of the house, one thousand eight hundred feet 
long, was surpassed by only one other in England, that of the ninth Earl of 
Lincoln at Clumber Park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Caversham 
was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>full of fine trees- 
particularly the superb cedars bordering the terrace - and must have been a 
paradise for the houseful of children living there at the turn of the century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not only was there a variety of trees to climb, but three ornamental 
lakes, to boat on in summer and skate on in winter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No clue now seems to survive as to why three lakes were thought 
necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, owing to the 
existence of an "outlier" of Clay in the neighbourhood holding up a considerable 
volume of underground water, it was very easy to creat ponds or lakes, and it 
may be that one at least provided reserve supplies for ice-making and the 
replenishing of the ice-house sited north of the mansion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As recently as 1915, a letter to the "Reading Mercury" pointed out that 
an excavation of about eight feet in this particular area would produce a 
permanent pool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The reservoir of 
water so close beneath the surface of the ground say, together with its 
proximity to the Thames, have been among the chief factors attracting owners to 
the place in the feudal past, when moats and wells were of such prime 
importance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a modern authority 
has pointed out: "All along the foot-hills of the Chilterns in Buckinghamshire 
and Oxfordshire are moats in numbers: they are almost dry now, but their 
presence proves that there were at one time springs in plenty where now there 
are few or none."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He attributes the 
disappearance of the water in modern times to present day drainage and the 
making of reservoirs. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Practically nothing has come down to us about the last 
twenty years of Major Marsack's life, which coincided with the first two decades 
of the nineteenth century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We do 
know, however, that in July 1812, when a case came up before the Berkshire 
assize court to establish responsibility for the repairing of Caversham Bridge, 
and the Oxfordshire county authorities pleaded that responsibility was Major 
Marsack's as lord of the manor of Caversham, the jury, under the direction of 
the learned judge presiding, found the county responsible and they were directed 
that in future they must keep the bridge in good repair. The original bridge had 
been built some six hundred years before by the then lord of the manor, William 
Marshal the younger, second Earl of Pembroke, who had shared the expense of its 
construction with the Abbot of Reading.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, expenditure on the bridge no 
doubt became the sole responsibility of the lord of the manor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Major Marsack died on 8<sup>th</sup> November 1820 at the age of 84, and 
was succeeded at Caversham by his eldest son, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Henry 
Marsack, of the Grenadier Guards - or First Foot Guards, as they were called 
then - aged 34.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Colonel Marsack had 
served in the army for seventeen years, taking part in the defence of Corunna 
under the command of Sir John Moore - hero of the imperishable jungle - and in 
other engagements of the Peninsular campaign, and had been involved in the siege 
of Bayonne when Wellington, after his arduous years in Spain and Portugal, 
pushed on into France on the heels of Napoleon's armies. Waterloo, however, had 
seen Marsack's Regiment, the first Battalion of the Guards, kicking their heels 
in their Portman Street barracks in London, left there because their Colonel, a 
crony of the Duke Of York's, had used his influence with him to retain a much 
coveted post as military attache to the Bavarian forces, a position he would 
have had to relinquish if his battalion had been ordered to the front.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Colonel Marsack retired within three month's of his 
father's death, and began to carry out a reconstruction of the mansion which 
transformed the place into a Regency style country house of great elegance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A delightful aquatint of 1823 shows that after the "extensive 
alterations", Caversham, now provided with a portico on the south copied from 
the Pantheon in Rome, and consisting of six tall Corinthian columns supporting a 
balustraded entablature, had emerged as a place of distinction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, the effort of bringing about this striking transformation 
completed the financial ruin of Colonel Marsack, the seeds of which had already 
been sown in his father's time, when he had started to raise money from 
moneylenders at exorbitant rates of interest, secured by post-obit bonds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The family tradition is that he was an inordinate gambler, and that he 
lost great sums at cards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is 
said, though it seems impossible to find any evidence for this, that the Dukes 
Of York and Sussex - who, on the assumption of his descent from Prince Frederick 
Louis, would have been his second cousins - were frequent visitors to Caversham 
during his brief ownership.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
Duke Of York was certainly Colonel of his Regiment, and was probably well known 
to him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1823, Colonel Marsack, 
after only three years as the master of Caversham, was forced to take refuge 
from his creditors by escaping to France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His departure brought him the further embarrassment of involvement in 
lawsuits with his sister Charlotte and others of his younger brothers and 
sisters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Arising from a quarrel 
over the share of their father's personal estate due to them, and about the 
validity of his will.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">The Caversham estate seems first to have been offered 
for sale following this catastrophe, as early as July 1823, and notices began to 
appear in the newspapers in June.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
One of these, published in the "Morning Chronicle" Of June 17<sup>th</sup>, 
1823, announced that the estate, consisting of the house, 1,000 acres of the 
best land, a manor co-extensive with the parish, quit rents, and the right of 
fishery, would be sold by auction in a single lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It spoke glowingly of "this singularly elegant MANSION and DOMAIN, 
Caversham Park, a Seat proverbial for its superiority over every contemporary 
within fifty miles of the metropolis and acknowledging no rival but BLENHEIM, to 
which alone it yields the palm", and boasted that it had cost Earl Cadogan 
Â£130,000 to plan and complete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
Warming to its task, it continue: "It is calculated to accommodate in the most 
ample manner a family of the first distinction; it is placed on a fine 
commanding situation, from which the views are exceedingly rich and interesting, 
extending at one point to Caesar's Camp, and including in the rich intermediate 
space an infinity of those admired seats that yield only to Caversham."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The place, it declared, was a paradise abounding with rare and valuable 
shrubs, umbrageous walks, and a great variety of hill and dale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It had the added advantage that "contiguity to Reading, and the 
importance inseparable from Caversham will give it that weight, with reference 
to Parliamentary influence, that could hardly make one of the seats a matter of 
doubt."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in spite of this 
inspired piece of "blurb", and its own undoubted merits and solid advantages, 
Caversham Park was not to find a new owner for another twenty years, and was to 
remain desolate and untenanted for most of that time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, in 1826, all the furniture and fittings in the house 
were sold by public auction, including pictures and tapestries, and a library of 
3,000 volumes "formed and selected by the late Lord Cadogan", of which an 
interesting feature was "upward of 100 volumes of Oriental illuminated MSS in 
the Persian, Arabic and Hindustan languages".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Six years later, an announcement ï¿½ published in the ï¿½Reading Mercuryï¿½ Of 
2<sup>nd</sup> Jul, 1832 ï¿½ stated that the trustees had directed that Caversham 
Manor should be sold by public auction at the Bear Inn, Reading, on 28<sup>th</sup> 
July; that it included Caversham Park, together with a number of farms and a 
fishery, totalling in all 1,031 acres; and that ï¿½the material of the mansion and 
offices will be sold by auction on the premises after the above saleï¿½ -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>provision which suggests that the trustees had at this stage abandoned 
the idea of selling Caversham Park as a residence, and were prepared to see it 
demolished, and the materials sold off for what they could fetch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was about this time that John Claudius Loudon<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn10" title=""><span class="auto-style13"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[10]</span><![endif]></span></span></a>, 
the noted horticulturalist and writer on gardening, visited Caversham Park with 
his wife, and inspected the gardens there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He found that, although there was still a venerable head gardener there, 
one Mr. Mum, ï¿½the pleasure-ground scenery is now entirely overgrown, and only to 
be recognised by a few cedars and other trees.ï¿½<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>ï¿½The kitchen gardenï¿½, he noted, ï¿½forms a deplorable ruin; the walls are 
overgrown with bushes, the hot-houses leaning in all directions, the back sheds 
roofless, and even the gardenerï¿½s house, which held out till within these few 
years, uninhabitable.ï¿½<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mansion, 
though dilapidated inside, he found in good repair.<o:p></o:p></p>
